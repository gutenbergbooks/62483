<h1 title="">A QUARTERDECK STORY.</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CAPTURE OF THE FORT.</span></h2>
<p>The friendship between Young Brydell
and Grubb the marine came about in
this way.</p>
<p>One morning in May, just after Admiral
Beaumont had finished the beautiful toilet he
made at precisely eight o&rsquo;clock every morning,
he threw wide his bedroom shutters to see if
the toilet of the navy yard grounds had been
made too. For the admiral was possessed by a
demon of neatness and order that is apt to
develop in a naval officer long used to the
perfect cleanliness and discipline of a man-of-war.</p>
<p>The admiral was the tenderest-hearted old
fellow in the world, but the strictest sort of
martial law prevailed in the matter of tidiness
in every part of the navy yard over which he
exercised or could claim jurisdiction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>A perpetual warfare raged between him and
the nursemaids at the yard. The nursemaids
<i>would</i> let the babies roll over on the admiral&rsquo;s
dearly loved grass, and the sight of white
dimity sunbonnets, dropped on the gravel
paths, was not wholly unknown.</p>
<p>The admiral was a bachelor of long standing
and had a wholesome awe of babies and
their mammas, although he ordered the
babies&rsquo; papas about without any awe of them
whatever. In vain he tried to negotiate with
the officers&rsquo; wives, offering as a basis that the
babies be permitted a promenade around the
main walks between two and four every day,
the walks to be immediately rolled afterward.
The officers&rsquo; wives simply laughed at him, and
the babies continued to kick up the gravel,
and the admiral retired completely discomfited.</p>
<p>As for the small boys at the yard, they harrowed
the admiral&rsquo;s kind soul to that degree
that he gloomily declared he would have the
flag half-masted and make the band play a
dirge before the very next house in which a
boy baby was born. Nevertheless he had been
known more than once to have begged small
boys off from the avenging birch switch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>To this general antagonism to small boys
one exception was made&mdash;Young Brydell.
He was called Young Brydell because, young
as his father, the ensign, was, the boy was
actually twenty years younger&mdash;being nine,
and a beautiful, terrible, lovable imp. Perhaps
it was because Young Brydell had no mother
that the admiral and everybody else, except
Aunt Emeline, winked at the mischief in which
he reveled. When Young Brydell drew his
first breath his mother had drawn her last&mdash;and
so from the beginning a tender atmosphere
of love and pity seemed to surround him.</p>
<p>However, the escapade in which young
Brydell figured that May morning had so many
elements of atrocity that the admiral at first
determined to punish him just as he would any
other malefactor. Grubb was the admiral&rsquo;s
orderly, and on this particular morning he
had just knocked at the bedroom door with the
letter bag, when he heard something between a
roar and a shriek that caused him to dash the
door open expecting to find the admiral rolling
on the carpet in an epileptic fit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Orderly!&rdquo; shouted the admiral, turning as
red as a turkey cock with rage, &ldquo;direct the pick
and shovel squad at once to level that construction,
and bring that young gentleman
here to me,&rdquo; pointing out the window to Young
Brydell. Grubb then saw what was up.</p>
<p>In the middle of the great lawn, just in front
of the admiral&rsquo;s house, was a dirt fort, constructed
with no inconsiderable skill. The turf
for about twenty feet square had been ruthlessly
torn up to make the glacis, and over it floated
a small American flag about as big as a pocket
handkerchief.</p>
<p>On top of the glacis stood Young Brydell
with a miniature rifle pointed straight at the
admiral&rsquo;s window. Around him lay the bodies
of:&mdash;</p>
<p>I. Reginald Cunliffe, the captain&rsquo;s only child
and a mother&rsquo;s darling, who had been repeatedly
told not to play with Young Brydell
for fear he would get hurt. At that moment
the mother&rsquo;s darling was representing a
wounded man and, rolling over in a new jacket
was asking in feeble tones for water.</p>
<p>II. Jack Sawyer, the doctor&rsquo;s son, who personated
a dead man with intermittent returns
to life to see how the thing was going.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>III, IV, V. Dick, Rob, and Steve, young
gentlemen belonging to the yard who obeyed
Young Brydell implicitly, although at least two
years older than he, and who submitted to pose
as Indians slain by his victorious hand.</p>
<p>VI. Micky O&rsquo;Toole, the washerwoman&rsquo;s boy,
who, although directed to fall dead at the first
fire, had failed to do so and was crawling forward
on all fours, with a knife between his teeth and
a tomahawk in his hand to assassinate Young
Brydell.</p>
<p>Grubb double-quicked it downstairs, but not
so fast that the admiral was not right on his
heels. The pick and shovel squad were just
passing as Grubb called out to them:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The admiral says as how that there construction
is to be leveled at once&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that young gentleman sent immediately
to me!&rdquo; bawled the admiral from the doorway.</p>
<p>The squad started toward the middle of the
lawn, where the turf had been slaughtered to
make Young Brydell a holiday. The admiral,
swelling with righteous wrath, remained on the
steps, and Grubb, laughing in his sleeve, made
a bee line for Young Brydell. Grubb walked
as elegantly as any officer and was a fine, tall,
handsome fellow to boot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>As the pick and shovel squad approached,
Young Brydell, raising his miniature rifle,
pointed it straight toward them and shrieked
out an expression he had read in a book.
&ldquo;Up, men, and at &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the men didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;up and at &rsquo;em.&rdquo; They
were too much engaged in watching the coming
conflict between Grubb&rsquo;s brawny arm and
Young Brydell.</p>
<p>The rifle wasn&rsquo;t much of an affair, but it had
been known to kill a cat twenty feet away.
Young Brydell, who had the face of a cherub
and the alertness of a monkey, quickly brought
the rifle to his shoulder and aimed it straight at
the approaching Grubb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The admiral says,&rdquo; shouted Grubb in his
big baritone, &ldquo;as how I&rsquo;m to bring you immediately
to him, and the Lord have mercy on
your soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grubb, in saying this, reached forward to the
rickety little flagstaff, meaning to save the flag.
But Young Brydell construed it differently and
thought Grubb meant to insult the national
ensign.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you touch that flag, you&rsquo;re a dead man!&rdquo;
shrieked he in his baby treble; and at the same
moment, the toy rifle being at his shoulder, he
called out to his demoralized command:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready&mdash;right&mdash;oblique&mdash;<span class="sc">FIRE</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And bang went the rifle in Grubb&rsquo;s face!</p>
<p>Grubb put his hand to his ear, and when he
brought it away, blood was plentiful on it. A
queer look came into his eye. &ldquo;By the jumping
Moses, the monkey&rsquo;s shot me,&rdquo; said Grubb,
reflectively and scarcely knowing what he was
saying.</p>
<p>The admiral, standing on the porch, gave
a sort of gasp when the shot rang out&mdash;and
every man in the pick and shovel squad stood
stock still for a moment. The boys, except
Micky O&rsquo;Toole, all ran away immediately.</p>
<p>Grubb was the first to recover himself.
Young Brydell had never lost his composure
and was now holding the rifle at parade rest,
and the rifle was exactly as high as he was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;You come along!&rdquo; suddenly cried Grubb,
seizing the boy and the rifle too, and forgetting
to drop the flag. It hurt Young Brydell&rsquo;s dignity
to be hauled off so summarily in the presence
of the public, and it also hurt his shoulder,
but he said not a word until he stood before
Admiral Beaumont. The admiral was small
and lithe and had a pair of light blue eyes that
could look through a man and nail him to the
wall&mdash;and these eyes were fixed upon Young
Brydell in a way that would have made him
flinch to the marrow of his bones, had he been
a man instead of a little lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;BOY!&rdquo; said the admiral, &ldquo;I sent for you in
order to reprove you for your outrageous behavior
in tearing up the turf and making ruin
and destruction of the government&rsquo;s lawn. I
find you, instead, guilty of a most terrible act&mdash;a
thing much more serious than any destruction
you might do to government property.
But for God&rsquo;s Providence you might be this
moment a murderer, boy as you are&mdash;for I
saw you take deliberate aim at the orderly and
fire in his face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir!&rdquo; chirped Young Brydell quite
cheerfully; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to shoot, you know;
I was just trying to scare Grubb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, Grubb, who had been standing very
rigid, with his handkerchief to his bleeding ear,
suddenly smiled broadly and whispered involuntarily
under his breath:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skeer Grubb!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; continued Young Brydell in
a tone of animated argument, &ldquo;it was like this.
We got up early this morning and built the fort&mdash;there
were seven of us, and it didn&rsquo;t take
half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were others responsible, then?&rdquo;
asked the admiral, for like everybody else he
had taken it for granted that Young Brydell
was bound to be the ringleader, if not the sole
culprit.</p>
<p>Young Brydell thrust his hands into the
pockets of his sailor suit, planted his feet wide
apart, and reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there were the others&mdash;but
I started it. Cunliffe was afraid; he
said he knew his mother would punish him,
but I told him I&rsquo;d do something worser for
him than his mother would if he didn&rsquo;t obey
orders&mdash;because I&rsquo;m captain of the company;
it&rsquo;s C company, sir, you know, and orders must
be obeyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, sir!&rdquo; said the admiral sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cunliffe was afraid, and so he did as I
told him. The other fellows, except Micky
O&rsquo;Toole, said they were afraid of <i>you</i>&mdash;they
say you are a regular Tartar about the
grass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;They do&mdash;do they? Continue, I beg,&rdquo;
replied the admiral with a snort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I told &rsquo;em,&rdquo; cried Young Brydell in a
triumphant voice, &ldquo;that <i>I&rsquo;d</i> fix <i>you</i>. I said:
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll plant the United States flag on that
fort, and won&rsquo;t anybody, not even the admiral
himself, dare to pull it down!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The admiral at this coughed and began to
twist his gray mustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I saw Grubb coming, sir, as I tell
you, I just wanted to frighten him, but before
I knew it, just by accident, sir, the rifle went
off, and the first thing I knew the ball had hit
Grubb&rsquo;s ear. But I&rsquo;m sorry for it, and when I
get my &rsquo;lowance next week, I&rsquo;ll give it to him.
I get a silver half-dollar every Saturday, sir,
from papa, but I think, sir,&mdash;I think Grubb
deserved what he got for hauling down the
flag, and if I&rsquo;d have thought of it, I&rsquo;d have
peppered his legs for him, sure enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>There was a pause after this. The admiral&rsquo;s
keen old eyes looked into Young Brydell&rsquo;s
brown ones, and the man&rsquo;s eyes had a kind of
simplicity in them like a child&rsquo;s, while the child&rsquo;s
had a determination like a man&rsquo;s. Grubb still
stood with a broad smile on his face, and the
blood dripped upon the handkerchief he held
to his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the admiral, &ldquo;will you tell me
what you think I ought to do with you and
your companions in mischief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;I think you oughtn&rsquo;t to do anything
with the other fellows except me and
Micky O&rsquo;Toole, &rsquo;cause we led &rsquo;em on. Micky
didn&rsquo;t think about the fort first, but as soon
as it was started, Micky helped me on and said
he didn&rsquo;t care if he did get a licking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not concerned about Micky O&rsquo;Toole,&rdquo;
said the admiral. &ldquo;Micky, as I understand,
occupies a subordinate position in your company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s first sergeant, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky, I take it, is merely your tool. Very
well, sir, I shall report this whole thing to your
father, and you must take the consequences.
Orderly, make my compliments to Mr. Brydell,
and ask him to do me the favor to come here.
But stop&mdash;your ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no matter, sir,&rdquo; answered Grubb,
touching his cap. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call by the dispensary
after I&rsquo;ve done my message.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The admiral stepped through the open hall
door for his cap, and putting it on as he came
out, said to Young Brydell with awful sternness:
&ldquo;Remain where you are until I return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Young Brydell very
respectfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">YOUNG BRYDELL&rsquo;S CHUMS.</span></h2>
<p>The pick and shovel squad were hard at
work, leveling the fort, and the sight
of his beloved turf so maltreated made the
admiral&rsquo;s heart ache. But he began to examine
the fort. It was very cleverly done, and the
admiral&rsquo;s gray mustache worked in a half-smile
as he stood and looked at it. Presently up
came Young Brydell&rsquo;s father, the handsomest,
trimmest, young ensign imaginable, but, as
Grubb expressed it, &ldquo;You see trouble in his
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Brydell!&rdquo; cried the
admiral quite jovially. &ldquo;Have you heard of
the doings of your young one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, sir,&rdquo; answered Young Brydell&rsquo;s
young father, looking unhappy, &ldquo;from the
orderly here, whom I asked. Believe me,
admiral, the little fellow has not a bad heart;
he is only mischievous, and he has no
mother&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the finest little chap I ever saw,&rdquo;
cried the admiral. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t going to shoot,
really; the thing went off by accident; he
wants to give the orderly all his pocket money
and takes the whole blame of this performance
on himself. Look at this construction&mdash;tolerably
ingenious this for a youngster.&rdquo; The
admiral groaned slightly as he said this.</p>
<p>The picks and shovels were fast leveling
the fort, but the lines remained still. Young
Brydell&rsquo;s father could not forbear laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll give him a hauling over the
coals,&rdquo; said the admiral, &ldquo;but I positively forbid
any other punishment. The little lad has
no mother, and we mustn&rsquo;t forget that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never forget it,&rdquo; answered Young Brydell&rsquo;s
father. &ldquo;I do my best by the child&mdash;I
keep him with me all I can&mdash;but as you say&mdash;he
has no mother&rdquo;&mdash; The ensign stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all about it,&rdquo; said the admiral briskly,
&ldquo;so come along and we&rsquo;ll try and frighten the
youngster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brydell smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t do
that, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but we can promise to take
the rifle away, if he isn&rsquo;t more careful.&rdquo; This is
about what the lecture amounted to after all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>When it was over, and Young Brydell was
marching off holding on to his father&rsquo;s hand,
he called out to the orderly who was coming
toward them from the dispensary:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Grubb, how funny that piece of court
plaster looks on your ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grubb touched his cap in response to the
ensign&rsquo;s salute and answered gravely:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels a deal funnier than it looks,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now make an apology to the orderly,&rdquo;
said the ensign sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Grubb, I&rsquo;m awful sorry the
rifle went off&mdash;&rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve got a big scolding
from papa and the admiral, too. But
you hadn&rsquo;t any business touching the flag;
you know you hadn&rsquo;t. Come around next
Saturday morning and I&rsquo;ll give you my half-dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanky, sir,&rdquo; answered the orderly, &ldquo;but
my feelin&rsquo;s is too much hurt for to take money
from you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Young Brydell promptly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you to my birthday party instead.
I&rsquo;m going to have a birthday next week. I&rsquo;ll
be nine years old; and I&rsquo;m to ask anybody I
like, and I&rsquo;ll ask you and Capps, the watchman,
and some other fellows. Will that help
your feelin&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course it will, sir,&rdquo; answered Grubb again;
&ldquo;and sailors and marines is so fond o&rsquo; one
another.&rdquo; Capps was a retired boatswain who
was a watchman at the yard, and as Grubb said
this he slightly closed his left eye.</p>
<p>On that understanding they parted. It was
Young Brydell&rsquo;s proud privilege on his birthday
to ask his own guests, and he had before
included Capps, who was until the advent of
Grubb his most intimate friend.</p>
<p>On this Saturday, therefore, there was a table
set on the broad back piazza of the ensign&rsquo;s
quarters. Aunt Emeline disapproved of the
whole thing, but Cunliffe&rsquo;s mother, who was a
kindly woman, saw that the cake was there with
nine candles in it, and Young Brydell sat
at the head of the table. All the members of
Company C, including Micky O&rsquo;Toole, first sergeant,
were present, and Capps, a bronzed old
seaman, and Grubb, who was almost as handsome
as the ensign, Young Brydell&rsquo;s father.
His ear still had a red scar, but over a bowl
of lemonade Grubb and Young Brydell swore
eternal friendship, and the friendship lasted
until the end came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>The ensign&rsquo;s quarters were just back of the
admiral&rsquo;s great roomy house, where he dwelt
in solitary magnificence; and Admiral Beaumont,
sometimes finding the house lonely and
silent,&mdash;as houses are where there are no women
and children,&mdash;would look from his back piazza
and often see a lonely little boy, too, in the
ensign&rsquo;s quarters. For Young Brydell was
never made to go to school as regularly as the
other boys, and was, unluckily, allowed his own
way entirely too much&mdash;all because he had no
mother.</p>
<p>The admiral, feeling sorry for the child and
finding a kind of odd and pleasant companionship
with him, would send Grubb over with the
request that Master Dick be allowed to come
over to luncheon, and even Aunt Emeline could
not ignore that request. So Young Brydell
would go off quite joyfully with Grubb and
soon be seated opposite the admiral at the
round table in the big dining-room. The two
would then exchange reminiscences&mdash;Young
Brydell pumping the admiral industriously about
&ldquo;When you were on the old <i>Potomac</i>, sir,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;That time you were in the siege of Vera
Cruz.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Behind the admiral&rsquo;s chair stood Billy Bowline,
once captain of the maintop but retired
because of deafness. This was a sore point to
Billy, who always protested: &ldquo;I kin hear everything
I wants to, and I never missed a call from
the day I j&rsquo;ined the sarvice, and I kin hear the
admiral a sight better &rsquo;n Grubb, the jirene.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
The admiral, though, always roared at Billy so
loud that everybody in the yard could hear
him bawling.</p>
<p>It was of course agreed that but one career
was possible for Young Brydell, and that was
the navy. The ensign thought so, and so did
the admiral and Grubb and Billy Bowline and
Capps, the watchman, who was a chum of
Billy&rsquo;s as well as of Young Brydell&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>One day, though, a strange thing happened
about Capps. Young Brydell, coming along
from school, whistling the bugle call, saw
Capps sitting in his usual place on the bench
in the shade by the ordnance building. Young
Brydell called out as usual:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Capps!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>But Capps did not move. His eyes were
closed, and Young Brydell, after playfully
prodding him with a slate pencil, went his
way. Presently he met Cunliffe, who also
saw the old sailor sitting so still upon the
bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have some fun with old Capps,&rdquo; cried
Cunliffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Young Brydell
stoutly. &ldquo;Capps is a friend of mine and I
won&rsquo;t have him teased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Words followed this, and it ended by Young
Brydell giving his young friend a kick on the
shin, by way of testifying his loyalty to his old
friend. Just then Grubb came along and
asked the cause of the difficulty. Young
Brydell pointed to Capps. Grubb went up to
him, touched him, and then came back to the
two boys, looking rather strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young gentlemen go along now; I
know the admiral&rsquo;ll want you to go along, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it after a while,&rdquo; he said
hurriedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The boys walked away, but from the window
in Young Brydell&rsquo;s room they saw Grubb and
another marine take Capps up, who appeared
to be quite limp, and carry him off to the dispensary,
and an hour or two afterward they met
Lucy, the apple-cheeked maid at the admiral&rsquo;s
house, with her apron to her eyes; she, too,
had been a friend of the ex-boatswain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Capps is dead!&rdquo; cried Lucy with a fresh
burst of tears, &ldquo;and ain&rsquo;t it too dreadful?&mdash;oh,
dear, oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys each turned a little pale. This
was their first knowledge of that unknown thing
called Death. Next day Capps was buried.
Ensign Brydell and one or two other officers
walked in the old boatswain&rsquo;s funeral procession.
He had always said he wanted &ldquo;a rale
lively funeral, like as a sailor man is got a right
to,&rdquo; and he was gratified. The plain coffin
rested on a caisson, and a squad of sailors and
marines marched behind it with the band
playing.</p>
<p>As the little procession moved slowly out of
the navy yard gate in the hot sunshine, a company
of seven small boys fell into line behind
the last squad. It was C company, with Young
Brydell at its head. The boy&rsquo;s sunburned face
was blistered with tears, but he was too much
of a soldier to wipe them away, while marching&mdash;for
he had been fond of old Capps and had
felt lonely ever since Capps had died.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Nobody attempted to stop C company.
They marched along in good order, their small
legs being equal to the slow pace of the funeral
procession. It was a long way to the sailors&rsquo;
cemetery and the day was hot, but C company
stood up to the work like men. Whether by
design or not they were cut off from a good
view of the grave when poor old Capps was let
down into it, and the next moment the band
struck up &ldquo;Garryowen,&rdquo; and to its rattling
music the sailors and marines stepped out at a
lively rate.</p>
<p>So did C company. But after ten minutes
the pace was too much for it. First Cunliffe
lagged behind, then one by one, even to Young
Brydell, they gave out, and it was a good
twenty minutes after the sailors and marines
had turned in the great gate to the navy yard
that C company, consisting of seven very hot
and tired small boys, straggled through. But
as soon as they appeared, the corporal of the
guard sang out &ldquo;Turn out the guard!&rdquo; and the
next minute the marine guard stood at &ldquo;present
arms&rdquo; as the boys marched through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;For it&rsquo;s the honor you did poor old Capps,&rdquo;
said Grubb to Young Brydell.</p>
<p>The boy had the usual habit of asking
questions, after the manner of his kind, and
one day when he and Grubb had got to be
very good friends, he suddenly asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grubb, are you married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a widower,&rdquo; said Grubb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is papa,&rdquo; answered Young Brydell.
&ldquo;The other fellows tease me and say papa will
give me a stepmother some day, but I don&rsquo;t
believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stepmother&rsquo;s a deal better&rsquo;n no mother
at all,&rdquo; announced Grubb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you any children?&rdquo; continued
Young Brydell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boy about your size, but he ain&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Brydell felt so surprised and also so
hurt at Grubb&rsquo;s want of confidence in keeping
these important facts to himself that he could
only stare at him. Grubb laughed rather
grimly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see, my wife belonged to better folks
than I. Her folks said she oughtn&rsquo;t to marry
a jirene, as they called me. Her father was a
master mechanic, and when she died, poor
thing! they took the boy, saying they could do
a better part by him than I could; a marine
don&rsquo;t git much pay, you know; and, like a fool,
I give him up. Now, in some way, the boy
don&rsquo;t seem like my child. He&rsquo;s got schooling,
more &rsquo;n I ever had, and he goes to school with
fellers whose fathers I waits on, and he&rsquo;s
ashamed o&rsquo; this here uniform I wear. So when
I seen how it was, a year or two back, I kinder
let the thing go. I send him half my pay every
month, and it don&rsquo;t pay for the clothes he
wears, they dress him so fine, and it seems
to me I oughtn&rsquo;t to bring him here, just to
associate with Micky O&rsquo;Toole and the rest o&rsquo;
the men&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I &rsquo;sociate with Micky O&rsquo;Toole,&rdquo; put in
Young Brydell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different. Micky knows how you are
goin&rsquo; to be an officer and as how if ever he gits
in the navy, &rsquo;twill be as a &rsquo;prentice boy, and
Micky ain&rsquo;t no sort o&rsquo; a aspiring fellow. He
don&rsquo;t want to be no gentleman. But my boy
does. And my boy&rsquo;s too good for me, that&rsquo;s
a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;He oughtn&rsquo;t to be,&rdquo; said Young Brydell
stoutly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good fellow; everybody
says so, and you&rsquo;re a handsome fellow, and
papa says he never saw a better set-up fellow,
and you&rsquo;ll be promoted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered Grubb, shaking his head,
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t eddicated. I know my business, but it
takes book learnin&rsquo; to make a sergeant or even
a corporal. I can read and write and cipher
some, but my boy could beat me at it before
he was eight years old. It seems to me like
the boy was mine and yet he ain&rsquo;t mine; but
yonder&rsquo;s the admiral comin&rsquo; and I ain&rsquo;t been
to the postoffice yet.&rdquo; So Grubb strode off,
leaving Young Brydell considerably mystified
about the marine&rsquo;s boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BRYDELL&rsquo;S FIRST FAILURE.</span></h2>
<p>Just six years after the May day that Young
Brydell had nearly shot Grubb&rsquo;s ear off,
on a day as bright, he sat with a number of
other young fellows about his own age around
a long table, answering the questions of three
professors who were examining them. Each
had a great stake in this examination, as it was
for an appointment to the naval academy at
Annapolis.</p>
<p>Young Brydell had ceased to be Young Brydell
then, being quite fifteen years old. He
has experienced a good many changes in those
six years. Much of the time his father, now a
lieutenant, had been at sea, but unluckily,
whether his father were at sea or on shore,
Brydell was still allowed to have his own way,
and a good deal more of the lieutenant&rsquo;s pay
than was good for a boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The old tenderness and sympathy still encompassed
him&mdash;he had no mother. Therefore
whenever Brydell found himself dissatisfied
at school a complaining letter to his father
would result in his going somewhere else.
When his teachers represented that Brydell,
although an extremely bright fellow and fond
of reading, yet neglected his recitations for
athletics, Brydell would write a most convincing
letter to his father explaining how impossible
it was for him to do more at his books when
his duties as captain of the football eleven
were taken into consideration, and his letters
were so bright and well written that his father,
as foolishly fond in his way as poor Grubb,
would persuade himself that the boy would
come out all right.</p>
<p>He had even been sent to Switzerland to
school, but like the other schools this one did
not suit Brydell, and six months after he was
home again. Fortunately Brydell possessed
certain strong traits of character that are difficult
to spoil. He was perfectly truthful, brave,
and had naturally a good address.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Nothing could have been prettier than the
devotion between him and the lieutenant. As
Brydell said: &ldquo;Dear dad, fatherly respect is out
of the question. When you got married at
twenty, you took the chances of having a boy
in the field before you were ready to quit it
yourself. I&rsquo;ll agree to treat you as an elder
brother, but we&rsquo;ve been chums too long for
you to come the stern father over me.&rdquo; And
this would be said with such an affectionate
hug that the lieutenant could only make believe
to growl.</p>
<p>And so Brydell grew up without any of the
wholesome restraints and self-denial of more
fortunate boys. He was not a conceited boy,
but he realized that whenever he had failed it
was because he had not really exerted himself,
and he had a naturally optimistic way of looking
at life, which so far had not been rudely
contradicted.</p>
<p>The determination to go into the navy had
grown with his growth and strengthened with
his strength, and no other plan of life had ever
occurred to him. He knew the difficulties of
getting an appointment, but like most happy
young fellows of his age and inexperience, he
thought all difficulties existed for other people;
his own way would be easy enough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>His father had carefully retained a legal
residence in his native town, expressly for
Brydell&rsquo;s sake, so he could be eligible for
appointment from that district. But Brydell,
having concluded to try private tutors for a
while,&mdash;which were changed as often as the
schools were,&mdash;had lived for nearly a year and
a half with his Aunt Emeline in a town outside
of his own congressional district.</p>
<p>One morning, picking up a paper, he had read
that a competitive examination would be held
for an appointment to Annapolis, open to all
boys who had lived twelve months in the
district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me to a dot,&rdquo; cried Brydell, and
from then until the day of the examination
he really worked hard, never doubting for a
moment his ultimate success.</p>
<p>Aunt Emeline, it is true, croaked like a raven,
but Aunt Emeline always croaked. Brydell
had already in his own mind composed the
letter announcing his success to his father
and another one to the admiral, who had continued
to be his fast friend, and another one
to Grubb, his old chum, the marine. On the
morning of the examination he therefore presented
himself and was duly accepted in the
competition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Next him at the table sat a handsome young
fellow about his own age. Something in the
boy&rsquo;s fresh, regular features and lithe young
figure reminded Brydell of Grubb. Of all his
early friends Brydell loved the kindly marine,
with his manliness and truth and bad grammar,
better than any of them. Although Grubb
had done his share of sea duty, he and Brydell
had met many times in all those years, and
always Brydell felt as if he were a little lad
again.</p>
<p>Once, Brydell remembered, Grubb, being
about going to sea again, had paid the expenses
of a long journey out of his small pay to see
him, and Brydell suspected that Grubb&rsquo;s ticket
had taken about all his spare cash, and that
he had lived on hard tack and a can of smoked
beef most of the way, which was hard on a big
fellow like the marine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>It suddenly flashed upon Brydell that this
handsome fellow might be Grubb&rsquo;s son; he
was about the right age. Brydell at this
pricked up his ears, but in a few minutes one
of the professors, happening to address the
young man, called him &ldquo;Mr. Esdaile.&rdquo; Then
he was not Grubb&rsquo;s boy, and Brydell lost all
interest in him, except that he wished he could
write the answers off as quickly as Esdaile
could. For Esdaile never paused a moment,
but with the ease and rapidity of one perfectly
accustomed to his subject he answered every
question put him.</p>
<p>Not so Brydell. He was well up in history
and geography, for he was a great reader.
But in mathematics he stumbled woefully and
made something very like a fiasco.</p>
<p>When at last it was over and the young fellows
each took his way home, Brydell felt a sickening
sense of failure. He had really worked
hard in preparing for the examination, but he
forgot that he had never worked in his life
before. His three weeks&rsquo; spurt had seemed to
him a tremendous effort that must win success,
but it had not. And then came a terrible
apprehension; if he had failed at this examination,
and he felt perfectly sure he had, he
might fail at another. He might even fail in
getting the appointment from his own district,
for the congressman might well hesitate to give
it to a boy who could not hold his own in a
preliminary examination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>This thought staggered him and almost broke
his heart, for he had dwelt so long on the navy
that he could not think what to do with his life
if his ambition in that way should be balked.
He was only kept in suspense a week or two
and then the blow fell. Esdaile had got the
appointment, and Brydell was at the foot of
the list.</p>
<p>Only a proud, sensitive, and inexperienced
soul could imagine the pain that Brydell
suffered. It was not alone the mortification of
failure; he had allowed his passion for the navy
to take such possession of him, body and mind,
that any serious setback to this cherished hope
seemed to him an appalling misfortune.</p>
<p>In his tempest of disappointment he turned
for the first time in his life, even in his own
mind, against his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not my fault,&rdquo; he thought in sullen
fury. &ldquo;I am bright enough, only I never was
made to work. And yet everybody talks about
my advantages. Was it any advantage that
I should never stay at any school more than
a year, and hardly ever more than six months?
Was it any advantage to me to be sent to
Europe where I picked up a smattering of
French and came home to find myself behind
every fellow of my age I knew, except in that
one thing? Was it any advantage to me to
have more money than almost any boy I knew,
to squander on athletics and all sorts of rubbish?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>This last reflection brought Brydell suddenly
to himself. He remembered poor Grubb&rsquo;s giving
his boy half his pay. &ldquo;And my poor old
dad&mdash;poor young dad, rather&mdash;gave me, I
believe, a good deal more than half his pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell had learned something about how
money went, and he stopped, startled at the
idea of how much skimping and saving his
father must have done to give him the money.
He fell into a passion of remorse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dad&mdash;poor dad!&rdquo; was all he could
think, and &ldquo;dad&rdquo; was so young&mdash;barely
thirty-six, and did not look a day over thirty.
&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; thought poor Brydell, with the
ghost of a smile, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why it was he never
married again. I was squandering his pay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Brydell was too generous a fellow to reproach
his father, except to himself in his first
angry mood, and knowing the lieutenant would
hear about the examination anyway, he sat
down and wrote his father frankly and fully,
admitting his failure, and his determination, if
he could get another chance, to do better. But
the lieutenant was far away in the Pacific and
it would be months before he could get the
letter, and perhaps other long months before
Brydell could get an answer.</p>
<p>Then he wrote the admiral in the same
strain. The admiral, who happened to have
shore duty then, got the letter. He was sitting
on the piazza, facing the salt sea, and when
he had finished reading it he brought his fist
down with a thump on the arm of his chair and
shouted:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The admiral always held that expletives were
vulgar; but when much wrought up he took
refuge in &ldquo;By,&rdquo; which might mean any and
every thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like the dog when he was about as
big as a cockchafer, and took the whole blame
of cutting up my turf, when there were six older
boys aiding and abetting him. Bowline! here,
sir!&rdquo; and in a few minutes Billy Bowline came
trotting along the hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me my portfolio and the ink,&rdquo; said
the admiral. &ldquo;That little scamp of a Brydell
has failed in a competitive examination for an
appointment to the naval academy, and how
his father could expect anything else, I can&rsquo;t
see, taking him to Europe, putting him at
school one day and taking him away the next,
and giving the boy no chance at all, simply because
he was too soft-hearted to say no! And
now the young fellow behaves like a man and
shoulders it all. I say, Bowline, we can&rsquo;t afford
not to have that young fellow in the service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, we can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Billy very seriously.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re &rsquo;bleeged to have him, sir, in the sarvice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is it to be done, you old lunkhead?&rdquo;
bawled the admiral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg your parding, sir, it&rsquo;s easy enough,&rdquo;
answered Billy stoutly. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;
in the reg&rsquo;lations as prevents a admiral from
axin&rsquo; the member o&rsquo; Congress from Mr. Brydell&rsquo;s
districk, if he&rsquo;s got a &rsquo;pintment to give
away; and if he rightly understands his duty
to a rear-admiral on the active list, he dasn&rsquo;t
say no, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William Bowline,&rdquo; said the admiral solemnly,
&ldquo;if you weren&rsquo;t the biggest ass I ever
saw, I&rsquo;d say you were a genius. Bring me the
navy register quick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The admiral glanced at the register and saw
there would be a vacancy in that year in Brydell&rsquo;s
district. He then wrote fourteen pages
to the member of Congress, and sealed it with
his big red seal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll fetch it,&rdquo; thought Billy proudly.
&ldquo;It looks like it comes from the sekertary of
the navy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Billy was starting off to the postoffice
with the important letter, the admiral picked
up Brydell&rsquo;s letter and read it over, half-aloud.
&ldquo;Esdaile, Esdaile; that has a familiar sound,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In course, sir,&rdquo; answered Billy with a sniff.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the son o&rsquo; Grubb, the jirene. You
know, sir, Grubb married a woman whose folks
was ashamed o&rsquo; him; and Grubb, like a great
big ass, give the boy to his wife&rsquo;s people arter
she died, and they stuffed that young &rsquo;un up
with false pride until he got ashamed to speak
to Grubb; and Grubb, he was a-sendin&rsquo; the boy
half his pay straight along. So then the boy&rsquo;s
grandfather died and left him a small fortin&rsquo; on
condition that he changes his name to his
mother&rsquo;s, Esdaile; and the brat were willin&rsquo;
enough, for he thought hisself too good to be
named Grubb, and now he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be a
officer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Here Billy rumpled his hair up violently to
show his contempt for Grubb&rsquo;s boy, and the
admiral again cried:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a great running to and fro between
the admiral&rsquo;s house and the postoffice
in those days, and the admiral and Billy both
began to feel anxious about Brydell&rsquo;s appointment.
The day was fast approaching when the
candidates must present themselves for examination
at Annapolis, and at last, three days
before the time, just long enough for the
admiral to write to Brydell and for Brydell to
get to Annapolis, the appointment came from
the member of Congress.</p>
<p>Admiral Beaumont was so happy when he
got the letter that he gave a kind of snort of
pleasure, and Billy, who was standing by,
eagerly watching the opening of the letters,
had to go out in the backyard to chuckle.
The admiral sent a dispatch and a letter to
Brydell, and Billy stumped off gleefully with
them, and three days afterward Brydell had
presented himself at Annapolis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BRYDELL&rsquo;S SECOND FAILURE.</span></h2>
<p>Far back in his babyhood, almost, Brydell
remembered the academic buildings, the
green lawns, and bright river at Annapolis,
and when on a lovely May evening he walked
in the great gates and passed the marine on
guard, he felt so happy he could have danced
and sung.</p>
<p>The weeks since his failure had been spent
in a dull and hopeless mental lethargy. Aunt
Emeline had been grimly consolatory and had
tried to impress on him that he had made a
lucky miss in not getting into the navy, and
named at least a thousand professions and
business ventures in which he could make
more money. The good woman did not see in
the least how it was with the boy&mdash;that he was
simply born to be a sailor, and that nothing on
earth could charm him then from his wish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>After that one outburst of generosity in writing
to his father and the admiral, he had settled
down to a sullen submission. It would be
months before he could hear from his father,
and until then nothing could be done. Suddenly,
like the lifting of a mist by the glorious
sun, came the admiral&rsquo;s letter and the appointment,
and within twenty-four hours Brydell was
on his way to Annapolis to be examined for
admission to the academy.</p>
<p>He had had no time to prepare for the
examination, even if he could. But a boy of
Brydell&rsquo;s temperament does not learn prudence
and caution in a day or a month, and he was as
perfectly sanguine of success in the coming
examinations as if he had not failed before.
He could have hugged the admiral for his
goodness, and had sat up half the night, when
he got the treasured letter, writing his thanks
to him and the member of Congress.</p>
<p>On this lovely May afternoon he walked with
a springy step along the brick walks of the
academy grounds under the giant trees, fresh
in their spring livery, and as he looked at the
velvet turf he smiled and thought of the
admiral and the dirt fort and Grubb and that
early time. It was not necessary for him to
report until next morning, so he strolled along,
the very happiest fifteen-year-old fellow in the
world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Presently sauntering along the sea wall and
watching the reflection in the water of a steam
launch filled with ladies and officers, he suddenly
came directly upon his old friend Grubb,
standing and talking with Esdaile, the handsome
young fellow who had so far outstripped
all the other candidates, himself included.
Esdaile started, and then blushing a fiery red,
nodded his head to Grubb and walked off.</p>
<p>As for Brydell, all the kindness he had ever
received as a little boy from the handsome
marine rushed to his mind. Grubb, as handsome
as ever, although a good deal older,
smiled delightedly as Brydell dashed forward,
but seeing how tall the young fellow had
grown, Grubb drew himself up and saluted as
he said: &ldquo;How d&rsquo; you do, Mr. Brydell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang the salute, Grubb! shake hands,&rdquo;
cried Brydell, delighted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a cadet yet,
so we needn&rsquo;t stand on ceremony.&rdquo; At which
Grubb and he sawed the air for five minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you come down here for to be
examined, sir?&rdquo; asked Grubb, smiling broadly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Brydell, adding shamefacedly,
&ldquo;I had a chance in a competitive examination,
but that fellow you were talking with&mdash;Esdaile&mdash;got
ahead of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this it was Grubb&rsquo;s turn to color. He
shifted his feet and said hesitatingly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brydell, please don&rsquo;t go for to tell it,
sir, but Mr. Esdaile&mdash;Mr. Esdaile is my son.
His grandfather&rsquo;s left him some money, if he&rsquo;d
take the same name&mdash;Esdaile; and as the boy
didn&rsquo;t like the name o&rsquo; Grubb, nohow, he got
his name changed by law&mdash;and I&rsquo;d ruther&mdash;I&rsquo;d
ruther, sir, the folks here didn&rsquo;t know it,
bein&rsquo; as I ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but a marine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell was so taken aback for a moment
that he did not know what to say, and Grubb
with unwonted fluency continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent in my application for a transfer,
sir, &rsquo;cause the boy don&rsquo;t want&mdash;I mean <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t
want&mdash;to be stationed here, a-doin&rsquo; guard duty
while my boy is in the academy. I&rsquo;ve talked
it over with one o&rsquo; the officers as I&rsquo;ve knowed,
and who has been a good friend to me, and he
says maybe it will be best all around. And I
hope nobody will know that Cadet William
Esdaile is the son o&rsquo; Grubb the marine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right in getting transferred
somewhere else,&rdquo; answered Brydell after a
moment, &ldquo;and if the officer advised you, I
wouldn&rsquo;t venture to say a word; but I don&rsquo;t
see why your boy should not want to recognize&rdquo;&mdash; Here
he stopped, not knowing how to
keep on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you, sir, long years ago as
how the boy was gittin&rsquo; above his father?&rdquo;
burst out poor Grubb, his eyes filling with
tears. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s ashamed o&rsquo; me; he&rsquo;s ashamed
to be seen a-talkin&rsquo; with me, and I can give
him half my pay, and I&rsquo;d give him all o&rsquo; it if
he needed it, but I can&rsquo;t stand bein&rsquo; looked
down upon by him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if you were my father, I shouldn&rsquo;t
be in the least ashamed of you,&rdquo; cried Brydell
hotly. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t had the advantage we
other fellows have had, but you&rsquo;re one of the
most honest and respectable men in the world;
so says my father and Admiral Beaumont, too,
and it&rsquo;s a great deal better to come out and be
honest and above board about these things
than to be skulking and hiding them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true for you, Mr. Brydell,&rdquo; replied
Grubb, who had natural good sense and much
more experience than Brydell. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your
natur&rsquo;. But it ain&rsquo;t everybody&rsquo;s natur&rsquo;. It ain&rsquo;t
my boy&rsquo;s natur&rsquo;; I wish it was. It&rsquo;s the easiest
way and the best way o&rsquo; gittin&rsquo; through life,
but it takes all sorts o&rsquo; people to make up a
world, and there&rsquo;s lots o&rsquo; people that could no
more be aboveboard than a pig can fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell had not lived long enough to appreciate
this truth, and he parted from Grubb
with a mixture of respect and contempt for
him, but with unabated affection, and a most
genuine disgust for Esdaile. Perhaps it was
helped a little by Esdaile&rsquo;s triumph over
him, but Brydell had always hated a sneak,
and he had very good ground for thinking the
accomplished Mr. Esdaile was constitutionally
a sneak.</p>
<p>Next day he reported and the examination
began, and then came a time that in torture
far exceeded the sharp disappointment and
sullen despair of the last few weeks. For, after
days of struggle and nights of furious though
ill-directed study, again did Brydell fail, and
this time he thought it was forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>When he knew it he had but one desire on
earth&mdash;to get away from the place anywhere&mdash;anywhere.
But where was he to go and what
was he to do that people would not find him
out? He hated to go back to that dreary
house with Aunt Emeline; his father was completely
out of his reach,&mdash;that too kind father,&mdash;and
Brydell felt sick at the idea of meeting the
admiral again.</p>
<p>Filled with the despair of the very young,&mdash;who
can see nothing beyond the narrow horizon
of the present,&mdash;Brydell, sitting in his room
at the hotel, dropped his head upon his arms,
and wished himself dead. He did not know how
long he had lain thus, only that the sun was
shining brightly in the afternoon when he
heard the dreadful news, and it was quite dusk
when he had a strange feeling that some one
was present, and there stood over him Grubb&rsquo;s
tall figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mortal bad, Mr. Brydell,&rdquo; said Grubb.
Brydell answered not a word, and in the silence
of the twilight the only sound was the melancholy
call of a night bird heard through the
open window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever are you goin&rsquo; to do now, Mr.
Brydell?&rdquo; asked Grubb after a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Brydell in a voice that
he hardly recognized as his own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better ask the admiral, sir,&rdquo; presently
Grubb continued.</p>
<p>Brydell made no reply. Then, after a longer
pause than usual, Grubb kept on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t had no rale preparation, I
reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Brydell bitterly; &ldquo;sent from
one school to another, as often as I wanted;
allowed twice as much pocket money as any
other boy in school, while my father was pinching
and skimping himself to give it to me;
with no home, no mother, to encourage me and
nobody to govern me; of course I failed. I&rsquo;ll
always fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go for to say that, Mr. Brydell,
and it seems like I ain&rsquo;t the only foolish father
in the world. There&rsquo;s others as had eddication
and all sorts o&rsquo; things that don&rsquo;t act no wiser
nor poor old Grubb the marine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word against my father!&rdquo; cried
Brydell, lifting his pale face for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be the last person in the world to say a
word against the leftenant, sir, but I say as
how &rsquo;twas always said of you when you was
a little shaver: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be hard on him, he ain&rsquo;t
got no mother.&rsquo; Well, now it seems to me
they&rsquo;ve been monstrous hard on you when they
thought they was bein&rsquo; easy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Brydell said nothing more. He knew Grubb
was telling the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, sir, let me tell you something.
I knows all about these app&rsquo;intments. You set
down and write the admiral and ask him if he&rsquo;ll
ask that there congressman to give you a year
to prepare yourself. Tell him as how you ain&rsquo;t
had half a chance, and give him your word as
a gentleman you&rsquo;ll pass next year if they&rsquo;ll let
you keep the app&rsquo;intment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Mr. Brydell,&rdquo; said Grubb.
&ldquo;Them as is ashamed to ask for another trial
when they ain&rsquo;t had a good chance, seems to
me, ain&rsquo;t got much sand. It looks like you
warn&rsquo;t willin&rsquo; to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Grubb,&rdquo; answered Brydell, beginning
to consider this sound advice, and before
Grubb left the room the letter was written to
the admiral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any good; I know it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
said poor Brydell despairingly. Nevertheless
he agreed to remain at Annapolis long enough
to get an answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>It would take about three days to get an
answer, supposing the admiral to be able to see
the congressman at once. Those days Brydell
remained shut up in his room. It was a turning
point with him. He retained only a dim
and chaotic memory of what he felt and suffered
in those three days; but at the beginning he
was a boy, and when he came out of the struggle
he was a man.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the third day a dispatch
came:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congressman will let this year&rsquo;s appointment lapse
and will hold vacancy open for you another year,
upon my solemn word of honor that you will qualify
yourself and pass. I rely upon you to make my
promise good.</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="smaller">GEORGE BEAUMONT.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The day was dark and rainy, but no June
morning ever seemed brighter to Brydell when
he read that dispatch. The transition seemed
to him like passing from death to life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>He knew he had never had a chance at preparation,
and he knew he had a good mind,
capable of learning what other fellows did.
But, above all, he felt suddenly develop within
himself a determination, a strength of purpose,
a power of will that could do great things
if he tried.</p>
<p>This new force was always a part of his character,
although quickly developed by a strange
succession of fierce disappointments. But impetuosity
was also a part of his character, and
with this new sense of manliness and responsibility
came a rash determination that he would
prove his sincerity by working for his living
while preparing himself for that other chance a
year hence.</p>
<p>Hot with this thought, Brydell wrote his
father a brief but eager letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And as I have known all the disadvantages of having
too much money to spend, all taken, almost
stolen from your pay, dear old man, while you are
doing without everything for me, and I am
determined never to cost you another dollar. I can
find work easy enough,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(sanguine Brydell)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and work won&rsquo;t interfere with my studying half as
much as play will, and I want to do something&mdash;anything&mdash;everything&mdash;to
earn the admiral&rsquo;s respect
and my own too. So make yourself easy, dad, about
me. I&rsquo;ll be at work when you get this, and you know
whatever faults I&rsquo;ve had I never was a milksop; and
I&rsquo;m going to behave myself; don&rsquo;t you worry about
that. So wait until next year and you won&rsquo;t be
ashamed of your affectionate son and chum,</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="smaller">RICHARD BRYDELL, <span class="sc">Jr.</span></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Brydell ran and posted this letter before he
had time to change his mind about sending it.
When it was gone he had a sudden feeling of
shock, like a man just under a shower bath.
But his word was passed. He had naturally
the strength of mind to stick to what he said,
and one of the things that had not been
neglected with him was a most faithful regard
for his own word. Rash his resolve might be,
but not to be shirked on that account.</p>
<p>When Brydell realized to what he had committed
himself he seemed to grow ten years
older in half an hour. He felt a little afraid, but
all these things were working together to make
a man of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">STRIKING OUT FOR HIMSELF.</span></h2>
<p>Next morning, bright and early, Brydell was
up and dressed. He had no one to say
farewell to except Grubb, but he wanted to see
his humble friend and avail himself of Grubb&rsquo;s
excellent common sense about his future plans.
For the marine had seen a good deal of the
world and knew something of it from a working-man&rsquo;s
point of view. Grubb happened to be
off duty that day, and early in the morning
presented himself in Brydell&rsquo;s room. Brydell
told him the glorious news, and Grubb, taking
off his cap and waving it three times, said in a
half-whisper: &ldquo;Hooray! hooray! hooray!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Brydell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go to
work. I have about twenty-five dollars left
after paying my hotel bill, and I can&rsquo;t go very
far on that. Besides, I&rsquo;d rather stay near
Annapolis. I can keep in touch with it better
in some ways. I have my books, you know,
and although I have only acquired a smattering
from them, yet they are familiar enough to me
to study by myself. And I&rsquo;ve got an idea
about employment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, sir?&rdquo; asked Grubb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, I&rsquo;ve been great on outdoor
life&mdash;riding and walking and swimming; and I
believe I could stand an outdoor life better than
I could being shut up in a dingy office. I hear
that the farmers about here find great difficulty
in getting hands, even at high wages and
particularly at this season of the year. If I
could get work on a farm, I could get my living
too, which I couldn&rsquo;t get in a city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, bless the boy!&rdquo; cried Grubb in great
disgust. &ldquo;The leftenant&rsquo;s son, a-talkin&rsquo; about
bein&rsquo; a hired man! Did ever anybody hear the
likes o&rsquo; that for a gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I am a gentleman, Grubb, and
that&rsquo;s why it is I&rsquo;m not afraid of work,&rdquo;
answered Brydell, who could not help laughing
at Grubb&rsquo;s look.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>After Brydell had talked with him half an
hour, though, the marine&rsquo;s ideas changed.
Brydell, who had been thinking hard on the
subject all night, reminded him of how many
young fellows walked the streets of towns,
asking for employment, while in the country
employment was waiting for twice as many men
as could be found. &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; said
Brydell with a slight blush, &ldquo;in the city I
might be all the time running up against people
I know, and if they were civil to me I&rsquo;d
probably lose the time with them I would have
in the evenings for study, and if they didn&rsquo;t
notice me it would make me feel pretty bad;
while in the country I wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to
meet a soul I ever knew. It always seemed
to me, too, as if a country life was healthier for
a young fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a sight healthier in every way,&rdquo; remarked
Grubb with energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I can get work right away in
the country, and who knows when I could get
it in town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brydell,&rdquo; said Grubb, &ldquo;the admiral
allers said, when you were a little shaver, as
you&rsquo;d turn right side up, and I do believe he
know&rsquo;d what he was talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The admiral&rsquo;s the best friend I have in the
world except you,&rdquo; cried Brydell; &ldquo;I believe if
you were an admiral, you&rsquo;d do just as much for
me as Admiral Beaumont.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Mr. Brydell. I ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;
but a poor marine, without any book learnin&rsquo;,
but whenever I sees that motto of the corps,
&lsquo;<i>Semper fidelis</i>&rsquo; which means &lsquo;Ever faithful,&rsquo; I
think to myself, Grubb, my man, that means you
ain&rsquo;t never goin&rsquo; back on another feller; and,
come to think of it, it do seem ridicklous that
the leftenant&rsquo;s son should be a-workin&rsquo; like a
hired hand. But I&rsquo;ve noticed, sir, as how you&rsquo;ll
put two horses to haulin&rsquo; bricks. If one o&rsquo; &rsquo;em
is a scrub, and t&rsquo; other one has a strain o&rsquo; good
blood in him, you&rsquo;ll find the scrub all petered
out by the time his work is done. But the horse
with the good blood&rsquo;ll haul all day, and be as
frisky as a kitten when you take him out; for
blood do tell, Mr. Brydell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grubb said this with a sigh, and Brydell
thought the poor fellow had his own son in
mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Brydell did not care to say good-by to
the few people he knew at Annapolis, so he
started out on a round, leaving his cards
marked &ldquo;P.P.C.&rdquo; at each acquaintance&rsquo;s house
and not waiting to see if they were at home.
He could not help laughing as he did this.
He imagined he saw himself at work in the
fields in his shirt sleeves, and thought it would
be a good while before he needed any more
visiting cards.</p>
<p>A natural tinge of boyish adventure made
him feel as if he would like to start out on foot
to seek his fortune, so next morning, having
packed up his belongings and left them in
Grubb&rsquo;s care, Brydell set out with his stick and
a small bundle and twenty-five dollars in his
pocket.</p>
<p>It was a lovely day, cool for the season, and
as Brydell stepped out at a lively pace, the
world did not by any means look black to him.
When he looked back six months it seemed to
him six years. In that time he had had one of
those plunges into real life which turns a boy
into a man in an inconceivably short time. He
had had a pretty complete experience of what
life meant, and he had set himself to work out
his own salvation in earnest.</p>
<p>He thought he would walk about twelve miles
before stopping, wishing to be at least that far
from Annapolis. But the beauty of the day, the
greenness and freshness of the country, led him
on and on until it was nearly fifteen miles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Then the weather suddenly changed. The
sky became overcast, the wind sprung up, and
the first thing Brydell knew he was caught in a
drenching rain. He had a rain coat with him
and he put it on, meanwhile keeping his bundle
well protected. He was still following the main
road and he determined to stop and ask for shelter
at the first house he saw. And how that
spring shower changed his views of life!</p>
<p>He realized he was wet and hungry, that he
was alone, and far from all his friends, and all
at once he began to feel very young. He
pushed on rapidly, and in a little while saw
across the rolling country a large and comfortable
farmhouse. He made straight for it and
in a little while he knocked at the open door.</p>
<p>A little girl in a white dimity sunbonnet came
to the door. She was about ten years old and
remarkably pretty. She did not show the least
bit of shyness and asked Brydell in hospitably.
Before he had time to answer, her father and
mother appeared&mdash;handsome country people,
looking, as they were, thoroughly prosperous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Brydell, whose manners were naturally graceful
and polished, introduced himself and asked
the privilege of remaining until the shower
was over, and with a secret determination to
ask for work later on. The farmer&rsquo;s address
was not nearly so elegant as the young fellow&rsquo;s
who cherished the ambition of becoming his
hired man. He said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Laurison. Come in and sit
down. If you&rsquo;ve got any dry clothes in that
bundle, my wife&rsquo;ll show you a room where you
can change &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell looked at Mrs. Laurison and his heart
went out to her instantly. She was not like
the officers&rsquo; wives he had known, educated and
traveled women; but she had a quiet dignity
and a self-possession that was equally good in
its way. And she had the softest, kindest eyes
in the world, and her voice was so gentle when
she invited Brydell upstairs to change his
clothes that he almost loved her from the start.
In a little while Brydell appeared with dry shoes
and stockings and another pair of trowsers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The farmer, being compelled to stay indoors,
was not indisposed to talk with the young
stranger, and Brydell had quite a gift of making
himself agreeable. They sat talking in a
large, airy, old-fashioned hall, with a dry rubbed
floor; and the little girl Minna was so pleased
with her new acquaintance that she came and
perched herself on the arm of his chair and
gazed fearlessly into his eyes with the grave
scrutiny of an innocent girl.</p>
<p>Brydell knew much about country life, and
talked so knowingly about cows and pigs and
horses that even Mr. Laurison grew fluent, and
Brydell imagined it would be easy enough to
get work there, and he quickly determined to
ask for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have any trouble getting farm
labor?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaps of trouble,&rdquo; answered Mr. Laurison
with emphasis. &ldquo;The negroes all go off about
this time of the year for berry-picking, just when
harvest is coming on and the corn needs weeding
the worst you ever saw. I&rsquo;ve got two men I
can count on that stay with me the year round,
but I ought to have four on a farm of this size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was Brydell&rsquo;s chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for work,&rdquo; he said diffidently&mdash;&ldquo;Farm
work, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Laurison. &ldquo;Why, you
never did any work in your life. Look at them
hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty brown, I think they are,&rdquo; answered
Brydell complacently, examining his own hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Laurison; &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re
brown with the playin&rsquo; of tennis and football
and such. Any fool can see by your hands you
ain&rsquo;t done any work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want to do some work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For money, for a living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you got any friends or family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a father. He&rsquo;s in the navy and
away off in the Pacific. I haven&rsquo;t any friend
that can help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has your father thrown you off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; but I want to earn my living, and
it&rsquo;s easier to get work in the country than in
town, and besides I know more about the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Laurison&rsquo;s manner underwent an instant
change. He paused a little while and then
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got any work for you;&rdquo; and after
another pause: &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s clearin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell rose at once. He felt that in a
moment the attitude of his host was one of
suspicion; but Mrs. Laurison&rsquo;s kind gaze never
changed in the least, and little Minna came
closer to him and caught his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going away?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; said Brydell gently, but feeling as
if he would choke. Mr. Laurison got up very
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you a short cut to the main
road,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The sun was now down and the purple
twilight was upon them. The trees and grass
were wet and a faint gray haze rose from the
meadows at the back of the house. It had
never dawned upon Brydell that he would be
invited to take the road at such an hour, and
he felt a strange sinking of the heart.</p>
<p>He thanked Mrs. Laurison for her kindness
to him. She said no word to detain him, but
Brydell felt she was sorry to see him go. He
then turned to shake hands with little Minna.
The child suddenly tiptoed and threw her arms
around his neck, saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come back to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some day, perhaps,&rdquo; answered Brydell hurriedly,
and feeling a sob rising in his throat
at the childish words. The woman and the
little girl had confidence in him. He said
good-by to them both, thanked Mrs. Laurison
again, and followed her husband out, and along
a path bordered with alders, to the main road
half a mile off.</p>
<p>Neither spoke a word. When they reached
a stile, beyond which the white line of the
sandy road glimmered faintly in the half-light,
the farmer turned to him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve done anything
wrong,&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t help suspecting you
have,&mdash;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t too late for you to mend. You&rsquo;re
young yet, and you&rsquo;ve got a whole lifetime to
make up for it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell had realized that the farmer suspected
him, but hearing it put into words was a shock
that altogether unnerved him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you suspect me?&rdquo; he asked in a
voice he hardly recognized as his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t help suspecting an educated
young feller with his father in the
navy, who tramps about, asking for work on
a farm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>In all of his grief and anxiety and despair
about his failing in his examinations, and when
he thought the desire of his heart was thwarted,
Brydell had never shed a tear. But when this
new horror came upon him, he did what he had
not done since he was a little boy&mdash;he broke
into a passion of sobbing and crying. The
farmer looked at him compassionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sorry for what you&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s a good sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry, for I haven&rsquo;t done anything,&rdquo;
burst out Brydell. &ldquo;I am as honest as
you are and as respectable. How do you think
you&rsquo;d feel if anybody accused you of being
crooked? I&rsquo;ve told you the truth. I got an
appointment at the Naval Academy and I failed,
and the congressman who gave it to me said he
would hold it over for a year if I would work
hard and promise to pass, and I wrote my
father I meant to work for that and for my
living, too, and I&rsquo;m going to do it. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Laurison hesitated for a moment. He
had the wisdom of guileless people, which is
sometimes better than that of worldly people,
and he saw that Brydell was telling the truth,
and he said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can come back to the house with
me and spend the night, and we&rsquo;ll talk about
work to-morrow,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Brydell stoutly, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t spend
the night in the house of a man that takes me
for a crook.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;I like your pluck, but you&rsquo;re a fool all the
same,&rdquo; was Mr. Laurison&rsquo;s answer, accompanied
by a friendly shove, &ldquo;so come along back with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell had meant to show great spirit, but he
was not proof against kindness, and he turned
and walked rather sullenly back to the house.
Mrs. Laurison and Minna were still standing on
the porch. The lamps were lighted in the hall
and dining-room, and the house had a hospitable
and inviting look. The two figures
appeared out of the dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; said Mr. Laurison, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought
this young feller back. He&rsquo;s all right. He
just failed in his examination to get into the
Naval Academy, and like a wrong-headed boy
he wrote his father he&rsquo;d work for his own
living until he could get in the academy,&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
have another chance next year,&mdash;and then, like
a man, he determined to live up to what he
said. So we&rsquo;ll just keep him to-night, and
maybe we can find something for him to do to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Mrs. Laurison said only three words&mdash;&ldquo;I am
glad&rdquo;&mdash;but Brydell knew they came straight
from her tender heart. Little Minna began to
jump about, singing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad! I&rsquo;m so
glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find I can work,&rdquo; said Brydell with
rather a wan smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked in the hot
sun a good many hours at cricket and football
and tennis and polo, and I daresay I can drive
a plow or weed corn or hoe potatoes just about
as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t half such hard work,&rdquo; replied the
farmer with a smile.</p>
<p>The evening passed quickly. There was a
wheezy piano in the parlor, and Brydell, who
played a little and could sing some college
songs, pleased his hosts very much with a
performance that would not have been so
highly appreciated elsewhere.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock he was shown to a comfortable
room, not the best bedroom, as he found
out, and turning in fell asleep in five minutes,
well pleased with his first day&rsquo;s battle with
the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A NEW LIFE.</span></h2>
<p>Next morning, by sunrise, Brydell was up
and dressed and outdoors. The two
negro men on the place were feeding the stock
under Mr. Laurison&rsquo;s directions, while a negro
woman milked the cows.</p>
<p>Brydell looked about and saw that the vegetable
garden was well weeded, but there was a
long straight walk down the garden, with flower
beds on each side of it, that were full of weeds.
There were clumps of lilac, both white and
purple, great masses of the syringa, making the
morning air heavy with its sweet perfume, and
snowball bushes blooming profusely. Some
early roses were out and a few gaudy peonies
still lingered.</p>
<p>Both beds and walk were choked with grass
and all manner of vagrant growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had a garden hoe and rake, I could
weed those flower beds,&rdquo; said Brydell to Mr.
Laurison as they met in the backyard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to goodness you would,&rdquo; answered
Mr. Laurison. &ldquo;My wife has nearly broken
her heart over those flower beds. I&rsquo;ve had to
keep the hands to work so steady that I actually
haven&rsquo;t had a chance to get at the flowers;
and she ain&rsquo;t strong enough to do it herself,
and it&rsquo;s just been a trial to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell had been taught to weed flowers
under that stern martinet, Aunt Emeline, and
when an hour afterward Mrs. Laurison and
Minna appeared, one whole square was as
neatly weeded as possible, the refuse piled up
in a wheelbarrow, and the garden looked like a
different place.</p>
<p>Mrs. Laurison was delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have done anything that
pleased me better, and a young fellow that&rsquo;s
kind and considerate to women and children is
apt to be a good one. If Mr. Laurison keeps
you, I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to let you have the
little bedroom you slept in last night, instead of
staying with the hired men in the barn, because
I see you are a gentleman&rsquo;s son, and your
mother&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any mother,&rdquo; said Brydell, his eyes
filling with tears at Mrs. Laurison&rsquo;s kind tones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s the more reason for being
good to you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Little Minna immediately dragged him off to
see her garden, which was the disorderly patch
which usually satisfied children, and then they
all went in to breakfast.</p>
<p>After breakfast Mr. Laurison and Brydell
had a business talk. Mr. Laurison agreed to
keep him a month on trial and to pay him ten
dollars besides his board. If he was satisfactory,
he could keep the place indefinitely.</p>
<p>Brydell never was so thankful and so relieved
in his life, except when he got that dispatch
from Admiral Beaumont.</p>
<p>How much better was this wholesome country
life than that dreary search for employment
in a city! And he had a good room to sleep
in, instead of a box on the top floor in a city
boarding-house, and country milk and butter
and vegetables to eat&mdash;Brydell had an astonishing
appetite&mdash;and his work, although hard,
was nothing like as hard as being perched
upon an office stool ten hours a day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>He had to buy himself some working clothes,
but, as one result of his training as a gentleman,
Brydell never appeared at the table without
being neatly dressed. This worked a much-needed
reform in Mr. Laurison, who before
Brydell came had no scruples about appearing
at the dinner table in his shirt sleeves. But he
could not afford to be less well dressed than his
young hired hand and he began to take more
pains with his daily toilet.</p>
<p>This pleased Mrs. Laurison very much, who
like most women attached importance to the
refinements of life, and who felt hurt to think
that though her husband put on his coat when
they had guests to dinner, he left it off when
they were alone.</p>
<p>At the end of the month Mr. Laurison said
nothing about Brydell&rsquo;s leaving and was
secretly rather afraid that Brydell had got tired
of his job. But not so; Brydell had a great fund
of sound sense, after all the nonsense had been
knocked out of him, and he knew he was in
good luck to have such a means of livelihood.</p>
<p>As soon as he felt any certainty about his
position, he wrote a number of letters&mdash;to his
father, to Admiral Beaumont, to his Aunt Emeline,
and to Grubb the marine, who had got
transferred to Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>He got very prompt answers from the three
of his correspondents who could communicate
with him. His Aunt Emeline wrote, saying if
he wouldn&rsquo;t come back, she couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;but
there was nothing urgent in her invitation.
Brydell smiled rather bitterly as he laid the
letter down.</p>
<p>The admiral&rsquo;s letter was overflowing. He
could not give Brydell too much encouragement,
considered him bound to pass No. 1 next
year, and conveyed a long message from Billy
Bowline to the effect that &ldquo;Mr. Brydell, he is
bound to be a sailor man, &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s built
that away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Grubb&rsquo;s letter, which was recklessly
spelled and not fully up to the standard of
classic English, bade him &ldquo;go in and Win.
You have got Sand, Mr. Brydell, and Sand is
what makes a man. Some fellows as learns
a lott out of books ain&rsquo;t got no natural manly
carackter and disapp&rsquo;ints their friends. But you
are not the sort to disapp&rsquo;int.&rdquo; Grubb then
went on to lament that he was stationed at
Portsmouth. &ldquo;For the cadets cruze will most
likely be here, Mr. Brydell, and there&rsquo;s one of
them, for reasons which is known to you, as I
would ruther not see in present serkumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Brydell knew that the poor fellow meant
Esdaile.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Brydell was working like a Trojan
at his books.</p>
<p>Every evening after supper he would be
claimed for half an hour by little Minna, to
play on the piano for her, to tell her stories,
or to amuse her in some way. Then he would
take a lamp and go to his room and study hard.</p>
<p>Often he was very tired, but it was a healthful
fatigue. He did not feel any sense of
nervous exhaustion, but, if he found himself
falling asleep over his books, he would go to
bed and get up at daylight next morning feeling
perfectly refreshed.</p>
<p>The outdoor life agreed with him wonderfully,
and his boyish figure began to fill out and lose
some of its angles. And he had the consciousness
of making headway with his studies. He
was forced to adopt the old-fashioned plan
of relying upon himself, instead of the new-fashioned
one of having a tutor to study with
him and to take most of the trouble off him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Besides making steady progress in studies
and character and physique, he actually found
himself happy. He had no associates of his
own age, it is true; the neighborhood was
sparsely populated and he did not find any
very congenial acquaintances among boys of
his own age, but he comforted himself by
thinking, &ldquo;Never mind, I&rsquo;ll have lots of fellows
for company next year.&rdquo; He came to like Mr.
Laurison; and Mrs. Laurison&rsquo;s kindness was
unvarying. Little Minna became the apple
of his eye.</p>
<p>In the summer she had a slight illness, and
Brydell did not realize until then how fond he
was of the little girl. He was always on hand
to do anything for her, and the child would take
her medicine more readily from him than from
anybody else.</p>
<p>This still more won Mrs. Laurison&rsquo;s heart,
and there was keen sympathy between her and
the boy who had never known a mother&rsquo;s love.
He often thought: &ldquo;If Aunt Emeline had been
like this!&rdquo; Minna got well quickly, but from
that day on Brydell&rsquo;s affection for the mother and
child became intense. Mrs. Laurison knew
that Brydell was preparing for his examination
another year, but as she said to him sometimes:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;The farm won&rsquo;t be the same for any of us
after you go away. I never had any boys of
my own; I always wanted them and it seems to
me now I feel the want of them more than ever,
because I see how nice a nice boy really is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never was accused of being a nice boy
by my best friends,&rdquo; cried Brydell, laughing but
pleased. &ldquo;Ask Aunt Emeline what she thinks
of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Minna, every mention of Brydell&rsquo;s
leaving was met by her throwing her arms
around his neck and pleading, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t
go away and leave me?&rdquo; Brydell partially
gained her consent to go, on promising that
he would send her chests full of magnificent
things and a dolly as big as herself.</p>
<p>Toward the last of the summer he got a letter
from his father. It was very kind and affectionate,
and almost humble in tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel that I have erred through my tenderness
for you,&rdquo; he wrote; &ldquo;but I hope that you
have experienced the worst you will have to
undergo of the effects of my fondness. I do
not know what you are doing now, and shall
wait eagerly to hear, but I rely upon your manliness
and uprightness to carry you through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell&rsquo;s reply to this letter was a very
cheerful one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>One day in the autumn, as Brydell in his blue
overalls was driving an ox-wagon loaded with
fodder down the lane, he suddenly caught sight
of a trim military old figure standing at the gate,
with another rather slouchy one, and the next
minute he recognized Admiral Beaumont&rsquo;s
hearty laugh.</p>
<p>The admiral was highly amused at the spectacle
his young friend presented, mounted on a
load of hay, while Billy Bowline grinned appreciatively
at the sight. Brydell was delighted to
see his old friend and, noticing that his employment
as teamster seemed to afford the admiral
great diversion, he cried out:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delighted to see you, admiral! Just let
me get my team through this gate and I&rsquo;ll
jump down and shake hands with you. Gee,
buck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; roared the admiral. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
sea room enough, my young friend, in which
to man&oelig;uvre that craft. You&rsquo;ll foul that gatepost
as sure as a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t; whoa!&rdquo; shouted Brydell in
reply. The oxen made a sudden turn that
really did threaten to foul the gatepost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your luff,&rdquo; called out the admiral,
waving his stick excitedly, &ldquo;and keep your
head to the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Brydell, who was not an
expert ox-driver by any means; &ldquo;you see she
yaws about so there&rsquo;s no keeping her head to
the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, after the expenditure of much lung
power, both by Brydell and the admiral, the
wagon got through, and Brydell, jumping
down, shook hands heartily with his old friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; cried the admiral, &ldquo;I
never saw a fellow grow like you. Why, you
are about a foot taller and two feet broader
than you were last year&mdash;eh, Bowline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He do grow amazin&rsquo; fast,&rdquo; said Billy solemnly,
&ldquo;and I reckon as how he&rsquo;ll be the
finest-lookin&rsquo; feller in the sarvice when he gits
there. But, Mr. Brydell, beg your parding,
sir, you ought not to risk your life, sir, in no
sich a craft as that. Horses is bad enough, but
oxen is the most dangersome thing alive. Like
as not they run away with you or kick your
head off, sir. Now, sir, aboard ship you ain&rsquo;t
never in no danger. That&rsquo;s the beauty of the
sarvice, sir, ain&rsquo;t no horses for to kick you, nor
no oxen for to run away with you; jist nothin&rsquo;
to hurt you; and when the wind blows, all
you&rsquo;ve got to do, sir, is to make everything
snug and git to sea, and there you is, sir, safe
and sound.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;The old dunderhead is right,&rdquo; chuckled the
admiral highly pleased, while Brydell in his
heart really thought a ship was the safest thing
under heaven, particularly a United States ship.</p>
<p>Brydell took his two old friends up to the
house, where Mrs. Laurison received them, as
she did everybody, kindly and graciously. The
admiral, struck by her gentle and refined manner,
bowed over the hand of the farmer&rsquo;s wife
as if she were the greatest lady in the land,
while Billy Bowline stood just outside the door,
twiddling his cap, and could not be induced to
sit down even in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t for the likes o&rsquo; me to be sittin&rsquo;
down afore ladies,&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like
mightily to have a word with that little &rsquo;un as
looks like a angel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Minna, after having made friends with the
admiral, was quite willing to make friends with
the old sailor. Presently they saw her put her
chubby hand in his and lead him out under a
tree, where they both sat down on the grass,
and through the window floated in scraps of a
thrilling narrative that Billy was telling her:
&ldquo;The prin-<i>cess</i>, she then give orders, &lsquo;Bring
up my palankeen,&rsquo; and she climbed over the
side and then she trimmed the palankeen, and
it&rsquo;s a mighty onhandy thing to trim, my
dear&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Mrs. Laurison invited the admiral to stay
to dinner, and he accepted frankly. Brydell
slipped upstairs and washed and changed his
clothes; then the admiral went upstairs, too,
and had a long talk with him. He took Brydell&rsquo;s
books and gave him a pretty sharp examination,
which Brydell stood remarkably well;
he had not wasted his time.</p>
<p>When dinner was ready they found Mr.
Laurison dressed in his best clothes, and Mrs.
Laurison had put on a pretty gown for the
admiral. The dinner was very jolly, and
Brydell was glad that the admiral saw what
excellent quarters he had fallen into.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>After dinner, when it was time for the train,
Mr. Laurison wanted to send the admiral to
the station in the old carriage that was used on
great occasions, but the admiral preferred to
walk. He and Brydell started off, therefore,
in the autumn evening to walk, with Billy
Bowline rolling along after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have waited to write to your father until
I should see you,&rdquo; said the admiral; &ldquo;but now
I can write with a cheerful heart. Zounds, sir,
you are in luck; a year of hard study, hard
work, and independence will make a man of
you. I thought your failure in your examination
the worst thing that could befall you. But
don&rsquo;t you see, youngster, that what seems to
be the worst may sometimes be wrested to
make the very best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell was not quite prepared to admit that
his two mortifying failures were the best things
that could have happened to him; but he
rightly considered himself a fortunate fellow in
the way his resolve to earn his living had turned
out. He told the admiral of the letter he had
received from his father, and what he had
replied. And then he spoke of Grubb and
Esdaile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of that Esdaile fellow, and
mark my words, he&rsquo;s a scamp. It&rsquo;s well
enough to elevate himself; poor Grubb is an
honest, sensible fellow, though uneducated;
but I hear that his boy would have nothing to
do with him, except on the sly, and actually
has been heard to deny that Grubb is his father.
I say that fellow is a pernicious, unqualified,
and unmitigated scamp and scalawag; and I
don&rsquo;t care if he passes No. 1 in his class, I&rsquo;d
fire him out of the navy in short order, if I had
my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently out of the darkness came the roar
and thunder of the train, the admiral wrung
Brydell&rsquo;s hand as did Billy Bowline, Billy saying,
&ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Brydell, I hopes as how you&rsquo;ll
git through and be a ornament to the sarvice,
sir, afore I trips my anchor and sets out for
the other coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell went back wonderfully encouraged.
The admiral believed in him, and that belief of
others in us does wonders. Even Billy Bowline&rsquo;s
appreciation was not lost on Brydell.</p>
<p>The autumn and winter passed rapidly.
Lieutenant Brydell&rsquo;s ship was still cruising in
the Pacific, stopping occasionally for letters
that were months in reaching their destination.
Brydell received several letters from his father,
all encouraging in tone, especially after Admiral
Beaumont&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The spring came on apace, and at last one
day in May, exactly a year from the time Brydell
had gone to Annapolis before, he was
notified to present himself before the examining
board.</p>
<p>Brydell felt reasonably confident. Not only
had he worked hard, but, forced to depend
upon himself and to solve his own difficulties,
he felt that he stood a better chance of making
a four years&rsquo; course than if he had been
crammed by a tutor to get through his examinations
and then make a flat failure afterward.</p>
<p>It was hard on him to say good-by to the
Laurisons, and Minna was so distressed at the
idea of parting from him that Mrs. Laurison
and he agreed that it would be better for him
to slip off early in the morning before sunrise,
so that the child would be spared the pain of
parting. Both Mr. and Mrs. Laurison were up
to give him his breakfast and see him off. Mrs.
Laurison said to him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever your Aunt Emeline said you were a
disagreeable boy, I think she must have been
a very disagreeable woman, for in the year you
have lived with us I don&rsquo;t think I could have
found fault with you if I had tried.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Laurison, it was because you
were all so good to me,&rdquo; answered Brydell with
tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>The farewells were said, and Brydell struck
off in the path that led through the field to the
little roadside station. Just as he shut the gate
that led from the path to the farm enclosures a
childish figure, topped by a ruffled dimity sunbonnet,
rose from beside the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you get up,&rdquo; said Minna, &ldquo;and I
knew you were going to-day, so I slipped out
of bed and dressed myself, for I heard mamma
say something to you about not telling me
good-by because I would cry so; and I&rsquo;m not
a cry-baby, and I want to say good-by too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell kissed her and promised to write to
her, and although she evidently wanted to cry
she did not shed a tear. Brydell started her
back to the house and Minna trotted off obediently,
but he saw her stop once or twice and
put her apron to her eyes.</p>
<p>In a few hours he was at Annapolis and in a
few days he had passed a splendid examination
and was formally notified that he was a naval
cadet at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SUMMER CRUISE.</span></h2>
<p>Esdaile was a third-class man, of course,
and he was almost the first person that
Brydell ran across. Bearing in mind what the
admiral had said about Esdaile being ashamed
of his father, it was not without a wish to make
Esdaile ashamed of himself that Brydell, the
first time they met alone, said carelessly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Esdaile, I believe you are the
son of one of the best friends I have in the
world&mdash;Private Grubb, of the marines. I
nearly killed him once, when I was a kid, and
after that we came to be tremendously fond of
one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esdaile&rsquo;s face turned crimson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather you wouldn&rsquo;t mention
about my father,&rdquo; answered Esdaile. &ldquo;You
know my mother&rsquo;s people, the Esdailes, were
altogether different from my father&rsquo;s. My
grandfather Esdaile was an ambitious man&mdash;the
Esdailes are a good family&mdash;and left me
some money on condition I changed my name,
and it would be awkward for me when I&rsquo;m an
officer to have it known that my father is a
private of marines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very awkward for Grubb,&rdquo; said Brydell
coolly; &ldquo;I should think your father would be
awfully ashamed of you. Grubb, you know,
is a fine man; every officer he ever served
under thinks highly of him; and you are evidently
a cad of the most pronounced description.
No, I won&rsquo;t mention the relationship, for
Grubb&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this was highly insubordinate talk from
a plebe to a third-class man. Esdaile straightened
himself up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that you are speaking to your
superior, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come off!&rdquo; answered Brydell carelessly.
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t any class question; it&rsquo;s a
mere private matter between us two. I say
your father, if he <i>is</i> an uneducated man, is
twice as much of a gentleman at heart as you
are, for all your education and your money
and your fine name, because Grubb respects
himself, and that&rsquo;s the first thing about a
gentleman, so I&rsquo;ve been told.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Esdaile walked off in silent fury. He did
not care to undertake to discipline Brydell on
such a matter, as it would only be proclaiming
what he earnestly desired to conceal, so he
swallowed his chagrin and determined to get
even with Brydell some other way.</p>
<p>Although hazing is strictly prohibited by act
of Congress, the milder form of it, known as
&ldquo;running,&rdquo; is not wholly unpractised, and Brydell
had his experience of singing the clothes
list to the tune of &ldquo;Hail Columbia,&rdquo; chewing
soap, standing on his head, for the amusement
of the Third Class, and various other of the
boyish tricks that seem to afford such intense
satisfaction to the third-class men. Brydell,
being a very good-tempered fellow, took it all
in good part.</p>
<p>Esdaile had no share in it, but avoided Brydell
as much as possible. Brydell soon found
out that Esdaile&rsquo;s reputation for straightforwardness
was none of the best. The code of truth-telling
is absolutely rigid at the Naval Academy,
and a fellow caught in a lie would undoubtedly
be forced to leave, whether the wrongdoing
came to the ear of the authorities or not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Now, Esdaile had not actually been caught in
a falsehood by any of his classmates, but there
was a general sinister impression that he would
just as soon lie as tell the truth, provided he
was not caught. His recitations had been
admirable, and he had very few demerits and
stood well with the instructors, but he did not
stand so well with his own class. Apparently
no one knew of his relationship to the marine,
and Brydell was quite above the meanness of
telling it.</p>
<p>Early in June the graduating exercises were
held, and Lieutenant Brydell&rsquo;s ship having got
to San Francisco a few weeks before, Brydell
was delighted one day to get a dispatch from
his father, saying he would be at Annapolis
before the cadets sailed on their summer cruise.</p>
<p>Oh, the happiness that Brydell felt one June
day when he once more hugged his &ldquo;dear old
dad&rdquo;! Brydell himself had grown and improved
so much, and the brief &ldquo;setting up&rdquo; process
he had gone through with had made him
look so much more mature, that he and his
father looked more like two brothers than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The lieutenant felt perfectly happy in his
boy. He had all along been conscious of the
weak points in the boy&rsquo;s training, and when
young Brydell had of his own accord cast aside
all indulgence and worked manfully in the face
of heart-breaking disappointments, his father&rsquo;s
joy in him knew no bounds. Brydell showed
his hands, which were rough and sunburned,
to his father, with pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look at &rsquo;em, dad!&rdquo; he cried with a
natural boyish conceit; &ldquo;got that by holding
the plow and tossing hay and feeding the cattle
and chopping wood. You ought to have heard
the admiral laugh when he saw me trying to
drive the ox-team through the gate. I&rsquo;m not
exactly a first-class farm hand,&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t worth
more than ten dollars a month,&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t
shirk, I can tell you. And you don&rsquo;t know
how much better it was working in the fresh
air, with a plenty of wholesome country food
to eat, than drudging in an office; and the
horses and cows were excellent company. I
pity the poor fellows that have to work in city
offices. Give me the country every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lieutenant gazed at him while a mist
gathered in his eyes. He could only say:
&ldquo;My brave boy! My brave boy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Brydell told his father that he must go out
to see the Laurisons, and the lieutenant, nothing
loth, went and spent the day. He came
home delighted with the kind people, for whom
he felt sincere gratitude, and he brought back
a large nosegay from little Minna and a childish
letter written in a big, round hand to young
Brydell.</p>
<p>Before the Constellation sailed, Brydell sent
her a cap ribbon with &ldquo;U. S. S. Constellation&rdquo;
on it in gold letters and a set of cadet buttons
for her jacket. Of course every cadet had his
&ldquo;best girl&rdquo; and perhaps half a dozen other
&ldquo;girls,&rdquo; generally young ladies older than
themselves. But Brydell maintained a mysterious
silence about his &ldquo;best girl,&rdquo; only admitting
that her name was Minna and she had
long light hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>One lovely morning in June the Constellation,
that had been lying at anchor in Annapolis
Roads for several days, set her white sails
and with a fair wind took her majestic way
to the open sea. She has never had steam in
her, and, except for being frequently repaired
and even rebuilt, she is very much the same
as in the times when she was one of the crack
frigates of the nation and when she made her
glorious record as a fighting ship. From the
days when she had come off victorious in two
fights against ships that were her superiors, and
had remained uncaptured, although blockaded
by a great fleet for years, in 1812-15, she had
been always classed as a lucky ship, and lucky
she proved.</p>
<p>To Brydell every moment at sea was happiness.
He took to seamanship and navigation
as a duck takes to water, much to Admiral
Beaumont&rsquo;s delight, who was not wholly reconciled
to the new-fashioned ships, where, as he
disgustedly declared, &ldquo;The chief engineer is
captain, and the ship is no better than an iron
kettle with an engine inside of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made their way along the coast leisurely.
Every morning the cadets were made
to go aloft and over all the rigging for exercise,
and they did it like cats. Brydell excelled at
this from the first with the utmost smartness.
Esdaile, on the contrary, although his class
rank was high, did not do at all well in the
practical exercises of seamanship. He was
growing more unpopular every day with his
class, and among the sailors he was hated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The blue jackets who worked side by side
with the cadets on the summer&rsquo;s cruise were
generally fine seamen and honest fellows, and
a pleasant feeling existed between them and
the cadets, although the distance between an
embryo officer and a sailor was necessarily
strictly preserved. Brydell enjoyed nothing
more than his turn at the wheel, when, with a
foremast man, he had his watch.</p>
<p>All sailors can tell plenty of interesting
things, and as they all liked Brydell they made
the watch pass quickly enough. Not so was it
with Esdaile. He treated the sailors with a
superciliousness and selfish indifference that
made them hate him, and they sometimes took
a sly revenge on him by letting things go
wrong, for which he was responsible, without
telling him.</p>
<p>When he was sharply called to account by
the officer of the deck or the executive, there
was a universal grin in the fok&rsquo;sle. With the
other cadets the sailors were only anxious to
shield them, if anything did go awry. Brydell
and Esdaile were upon the most distant terms,
and neither showed any disposition to change
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>After a leisurely cruise along the coast they
reached Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It was
a soft July evening, and the wind was fair for
them to enter the difficult harbor. Brydell,
with Atkins, a very smart sailor, was at the
wheel when they were weathering the Point.</p>
<p>It requires skilful seamanship for a sailing
vessel to weather this dangerous point, where
the slightest mistake in the moment to put the
helm up or down will place a ship on the rocks.
The captain trusted nobody but himself to
bring the frigate in. The ship, with all her
light canvas set, floated lightly on almost like
a phantom ship.</p>
<p>The Piscataqua is one of the most beautiful
rivers on the Atlantic coast, and in the pale
sunset glow the water shimmered like a sea of
opal. The white-winged Constellation came
on and on, without tacking, and seemed literally
rushing upon her doom as the rocky point
reared itself menacingly in her way. But when
so near that her bowsprit almost touched the
rock, the captain, who stood at the steersman&rsquo;s
side, gave the word, and the ship, answering
her helm beautifully, came about like magic
and rounded the dangerous point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>In a little while she reached her anchorage,
and came to anchor in true man-of-war style,
her sails being furled and her anchors dropped
in an inconceivably short time.</p>
<p>Brydell was at that happy age when every
change seems delightful, and he was just as
glad to get ashore at Portsmouth as if he had
not enjoyed every moment when he was actually
cruising.</p>
<p>He looked forward with the greatest pleasure
to seeing his old friend Grubb, and only regretted
the forms which must be observed
between an officer and a private. Grubb was
such a sensible, self-respecting fellow that he
was not at all likely to let Brydell&rsquo;s natural
generosity lead him beyond the right point
with a subordinate.</p>
<p>Brydell made up his mind that Grubb would
keep off the ship if possible, and determined
the first time he got leave to go ashore to hunt
up his humble friend. But the very next
morning, happening to go on deck, he ran
across Grubb delivering a message to the officer
of the deck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Grubb touched his cap respectfully to Brydell,
but his pleasure was evident in his handsome
sunburned face. The officer was just handing
him a note. Brydell could not help shaking
hands with the marine, saying to the officer,
&ldquo;Private Grubb and I are old friends. I have
known him ever since I was a little lad. He
got me the very worst wigging I ever had, for
almost killing him with my parlor rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer smiled and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Private Grubb must be a good man to have
remained in the service so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno about that, sir,&rdquo; answered Grubb,
blushing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in the sarvice twenty-four
years, now going on twenty-five. I ain&rsquo;t never
asked for promotion, because I ain&rsquo;t a eddicated
man, and I&rsquo;m very well satisfied with my
increased pay, but I reckon I&rsquo;ll stay Private
Grubb as long as the government&rsquo;ll let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Esdaile appeared, strolling along
the deck. The instant Grubb caught sight of
him the marine&rsquo;s face changed and hardened.
The officer detained him a moment to add
something to the note he had written, and Brydell
stood talking with the marine. Esdaile&rsquo;s
face did not show the slightest recognition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>No one on the ship except Brydell knew of
the relationship, and as he had not thought fit
to mention it, Esdaile in his selfish soul hoped
that it would not be suspected. Certainly it
would not be from the manner of either father
or son.</p>
<p>The officer had come back then, and giving
his note to Grubb, and civilly returning his
salute, the marine went over the side and was
soon being pulled away in the boat.</p>
<p>Brydell remained talking with the officer, who
was very friendly to him, and telling the story
of the parlor rifle which came so near being a
tragedy instead of a comedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my father and Admiral Beaumont
both say that Grubb is one of the most
deserving men they ever knew, and he could
have had promotion lots of times, except
that he is a timid sort of an old fellow about
some things, although as brave as a lion in
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men are very valuable,&rdquo; answered the
officer, &ldquo;and you youngsters ought to treat them
with the highest consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Grubb and I have always been the
greatest chums in the world,&rdquo; said Brydell,
showing his boyish dimples in a smile. &ldquo;The
only thing I regret in being a cadet is that I
can&rsquo;t go and spend the day with Grubb at his
quarters as I used to when I was ten years old,
and eat salt pork and boiled onions; how good
it tasted then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell had despised Esdaile before, but after
that utter ignoring of his father, Esdaile became
even more contemptible than ever in his eyes.
Nor did he ever see the slightest recognition
afterward between the two. They constantly
met on shore, but never exchanged a word or a
sign, except the conventional salute.</p>
<p>Brydell indeed could not go to Grubb&rsquo;s quarters
as he had done as a little boy, but when he
had leave, he would sometimes get a boat and
he and Grubb would go fishing as in the old
days, and be very happy together. Everybody
on the ship knew of the old association between
them, and the fondness of the smart young
cadet for the grizzled marine was perfectly
understood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A QUESTION OF HONOR.</span></h2>
<p>Esdaile avoided Brydell more than ever
at Portsmouth, and as they were in
different classes it was easy for them to see
but little of each other. One night, though,
Brydell having come on board, after a day&rsquo;s
leave spent fishing with Grubb, was met by a
third-class man as soon as he had got on board
and reported. This was his old acquaintance
Cunliffe, who had turned out a remarkably
quiet and level-headed young fellow and belonged
to the section in every class which
keeps up the tone and discipline of the class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brydell,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will you come into the
steerage with me? Something very important
is on hand, and we want your testimony.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Brydell went, quite ignorant of what was up,
except the surmise that some infringement of
the code of cadet ethics was under discussion,
and he knew from Cunliffe&rsquo;s manner it was
something serious. For among these cadets
there is a rigid code of ethics which is carried
out with a stern impartiality that would do
honor to much older men.</p>
<p>Uncontaminated by the influences of self-interest,
which are learned later in life, these
young fellows insist upon certain points of
honor so tenaciously that they can practically
drive any cadet out of the academy who does
not live up to them. And the greatest of
these is truthfulness.</p>
<p>Any failure to tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, is regarded
as unfitting a cadet for any association with
his fellows, and so well understood is this that
there are few offences against truth. Two
things, lying and tale-bearing, are treated as
crimes, and a cadet convicted of them is not
only put in Coventry, but every other cadet
makes it his business to load the offender
down with demerits, so that the class may be
relieved of his presence. It is stern, but the
effect is indescribably good.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Brydell followed Cunliffe to the steerage and
sitting around the table were about a dozen of
the oldest and steadiest members of the third
class, while others were grouped about as
listeners. Esdaile, looking deadly pale, sat in
a chair a little way off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brydell,&rdquo; said the oldest of them, Maxwell,&mdash;known
as &ldquo;Old McSwell,&rdquo; because of
his elegant appearance, but who was one of
the most reliable young fellows in the class,&mdash;&ldquo;we
want your testimony in regard to a question
affecting Mr. Esdaile&rsquo;s honor. It has been
whispered about the ship that Mr. Esdaile is
the son of Private Grubb of the marines,
whom you say you have known nearly all your
life. The difference in their names is explained
by Mr. Esdaile taking another name. Some
days ago Mr. Esdaile went to call on the
captain&rsquo;s wife at the hotel, and in the course
of conversation complained that this report,
which he considered injurious to him, was
going about. He denied flatly that Private
Grubb was his father, and said he was the
son of Thomas Esdaile. The captain&rsquo;s wife
thereupon denied it and has been very much
embarrassed by hearing from the very best
authority that Private Grubb really is Mr.
Esdaile&rsquo;s father. Can you give us any facts
in the case?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>The first idea that occurred to Brydell as he
looked at the culprit was, &ldquo;What a fool!&rdquo;
Esdaile had stood near the top of his class;
still he lacked the good sense that almost
invariably goes with good morals and had told
a lie which, like all lies, must in the end be
detected. Brydell could feel no sympathy for
Esdaile, but the idea of poor Grubb&rsquo;s distress
shook him. He hesitated a moment or two
before he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all the facts, I think,&rdquo; he said in a
low voice. &ldquo;Private Grubb is Mr. Esdaile&rsquo;s
father. I have known it ever since I knew
Private Grubb, seven or eight years ago. Mr.
Esdaile&rsquo;s grandfather gave him some money
on condition that he should take the name of
his mother&rsquo;s family, Esdaile. I want to say
right here that Private Grubb is one of the
best men in the world. Admiral Beaumont
and my father have both said so a hundred
times in my presence, and although he is a
plain, uneducated man, not one of us here
need be ashamed to own him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>At this there was a long and painful pause.
Esdaile&rsquo;s face, that had been pale, turned a
greenish hue; he had still enough sense left
to feel the accumulated scorn of his classmates.
It was a solemn moment for those
young judges. Esdaile had not been popular
among them, but they fully realized that they
were branding him in a way he would probably
retain as long as he lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you anything to say, Mr. Esdaile?&rdquo;
asked Maxwell.</p>
<p>Esdaile&rsquo;s lips formed the word &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;
but no sound was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the opinion of your class,&rdquo; continued
Maxwell after a pause, &ldquo;that it would be best
for you to resign at once. If you think differently,
you may depend upon it that the class
will take every means of making the academy
too hot to hold you. Some liars and tale-bearers
have been found who tried to stick it
out, but there is no instance recorded of any
one of them succeeding. You may go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes they had all scattered.
Most of them went on deck, where in little
groups they discussed the matter gravely and
with heavy hearts, for the presence of meanness
and dishonor is among the most painful
things in the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>The officers said no word to the cadets about
it, nor did the cadets speak of it to the officers.
It was within their own province to maintain
the standard of probity in their class, and they
had a stern and effective way of doing it.
Therefore when for the next few days no cadet
spoke to Esdaile except when absolutely required
in the performance of duty, the officers
saw plainly enough what was in the wind.</p>
<p>Within another week Esdaile received an
imposing document from the navy department,
and everybody knew that his resignation had
been accepted. He formally announced it to
the captain, who asked no questions. The
officers bade him a distant good-by, and in
two hours from the time Esdaile received the
notification he was off the ship and, as his
classmates supposed, forever out of the navy.</p>
<p>Brydell had been almost broken-hearted
over the effect of Esdaile&rsquo;s disgrace upon
poor Grubb. He wanted to go to see the
marine at once, but could not get leave for
a day or two. Then he was suddenly taken
down with a violent cold and fever. He managed
to write a few agitated lines to Grubb,
but got no answer. It was nearly ten days
before he was well enough to leave the ship
and go in search of his friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>It was about dusk of the midsummer evening
when Brydell, rather pale from his recent
illness, was going toward Grubb&rsquo;s quarters.
Halfway there he met the surgeon, Dr. Wayne,
a kindly, elderly man, who Brydell knew had
known the marine for many years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me, sir, anything about Private
Grubb of the marines?&rdquo; asked Brydell
without mentioning Esdaile at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether he can be called
Private Grubb of the marines any longer,&rdquo;
answered the doctor with solemn eyes.
&ldquo;His time was up the very day he heard
of his son&rsquo;s disgrace. He was on his way to
the office ready to re&euml;nlist when he heard it.
He walked straight to the office,&mdash;you know
what a fine, erect fellow he was,&mdash;asked for
his discharge without a word of explanation,
except to know when he could get his papers,
and turned away. He had not got a block
before he fell. People ran and picked him
up,&mdash;he had on his uniform,&mdash;and they were
going to carry him to the hospital, but he
wouldn&rsquo;t let them. He said he was out of the
service, and he had no right to go, and no
wish to go, nor could they make him go. I
happened to be near by and went to him. I said:
&lsquo;You must go to the hospital.&rsquo; You see, he was
such a sort of institution that I couldn&rsquo;t quite
take in why he shouldn&rsquo;t obey orders. He
tried to touch his cap and managed to say:
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve worn this uniform twenty-four years and
I have never disobeyed an officer, but I can&rsquo;t go
to the hospital.&rsquo; He became so excited over
it that for fear it would kill him I let them take
him into a little tavern at hand, a respectable
sort of a place patronized by workingmen.
I saw he had had a stroke, and that it was
a mortal one. He asked to be left alone
with me, and then that poor fellow begged
and pleaded with me not to send him to the
hospital, where everybody would know him
and know of his son&rsquo;s disgrace&mdash;he told
me all about it. I couldn&rsquo;t have forced him
to go after that, if it had cost me my commission.
He&rsquo;s going to die, and as he is a
good and faithful man he shall die in as much
peace as I can give him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Brydell grew a little faint at the words,
and in an instant he was carried back to
that day so long ago when old Capps the
boatswain had been carried out of the navy
yard gate on a caisson. He had not been
brought face to face with majestic Death
since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But mightn&rsquo;t he get well?&rdquo; Brydell began
and halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;he can&rsquo;t get well,&rdquo; answered the
doctor quietly. &ldquo;Poor honest Grubb is dying
of grief and shame over his son&rsquo;s disgrace. I
and the other surgeons here have worked over
him faithfully; if he had been the ranking
officer in the marine corps, we couldn&rsquo;t have
done any more. But when a man is sick of
life it is an incurable disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see him,&rdquo; said Brydell with pale
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to see him, by all means. If you can
rouse him, you will do him more good than
all the doctors in the world can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell walked rapidly through the fast-closing
evening to the little tavern in a back
street. The proprietor, in his shirt sleeves,
answered his inquiries civilly enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; all we can for poor Grubb,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but I never see a man so hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Brydell stumbled up the narrow stairs to
the little back room where, in response to
his knock, Grubb&rsquo;s voice weakly answered:
&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; Brydell entered.</p>
<p>On the narrow bed Grubb&rsquo;s gaunt figure,
only a little while ago so trim and soldierly,
was stretched out. His skin had lost its ruddy
glow and was quite grayish, and his eyes
had sunk back into his head until they seemed
cavernous. Brydell advanced to the bed and
took his hand. He was not prepared for the
change in poor Grubb, and his boyish face
wore a startled look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knowed you would come as soon as
you could,&rdquo; the marine began. &ldquo;I asked for
you right after&mdash;right after&mdash;it happened.
They told me you was sick. I got that note
you wrote me. It&rsquo;s a mighty comfort to me to
know there&rsquo;s one honest boy in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell could not say a word. He sat down
in a chair by the bed, and in spite of every
effort to control himself tears started from
his eyes and fell on Grubb&rsquo;s thin hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Brydell, what are you a-cryin&rsquo;
for? You don&rsquo;t want me to live in this here
world where things is so hard. And you see
I&rsquo;m to blame some about that boy. I give him
all I had, and I didn&rsquo;t require nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; him
in return. When he first began to be
ashamed of me, instead of makin&rsquo; him see as
how I was to be treated with respect, because
I was his father and a respectable man to boot,
I let it go and sneaked out of his way. But I
think he must &rsquo;a&rsquo; been born a liar, &rsquo;cause your
father the leftenant indulged you just as
much as I did my boy, but you allers was a up
and down truthful boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything of&mdash;of Esdaile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, and I don&rsquo;t count on hearin&rsquo;,
neither. He&rsquo;s got some money, and as long
as that holds out it&rsquo;s all he cares for. And
besides, I ain&rsquo;t got no pay now. You see
I just felt it like a flash, the minute I heard
o&rsquo; that boy&rsquo;s disgrace, as if I didn&rsquo;t want to
wear this here uniform unless I could walk
down the main street lookin&rsquo; folks square in
the eye. I had worn that uniform twenty-four
years and there wasn&rsquo;t no commissioned officer
as kep&rsquo; himself straighter nor cleaner nor
prouder than Grubb the marine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Grubb.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Brydell, I couldn&rsquo;t look anybody
in the face after that, so I asked for my discharge
papers instead of re&euml;nlistin&rsquo;, and then
I dropped down in the street and it give me
sort o&rsquo; relief to know that I couldn&rsquo;t git over it,
because them doctors,&mdash;they&rsquo;re mighty kind
and attentive, and they sets where you&rsquo;re settin&rsquo;
and tries to skeer me into gittin&rsquo; well,&mdash;and
I know I can&rsquo;t git well, and I don&rsquo;t want
to git well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell could not say a word. There was
something imposing in the fierce, simple honor
of the man who preferred dying to living
because he &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t look anybody in the
face again.&rdquo; Presently Grubb spoke again
feebly: &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll give my respectful compliments
to the leftenant and Admiral Beaumont,
and tell &rsquo;em as how I hope I&rsquo;ve did my
duty to their satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Brydell.</p>
<p>He sat there and talked a long time with
Grubb&mdash;talked with him until he had barely
time to catch the ship&rsquo;s boat, and had to run
every step of the way to the dock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">GRUBB&rsquo;S HONORABLE DISCHARGE.</span></h2>
<p>All the night and the next day Brydell&rsquo;s
heart was heavy for his old friend. The
next evening at the same time he got leave.
The officers knew of Brydell&rsquo;s affection for
Grubb, and he had no difficulty in getting off
when they knew where he wished to go.</p>
<p>Walking rapidly along the street from the
wharf, whom should Brydell almost run over
but Admiral Beaumont with Billy Bowline as
always rolling along behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking about you, boy!&rdquo;
shouted the admiral. &ldquo;Where are you going
in such a hurry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to see poor Grubb, sir,&rdquo; answered
Brydell, shaking hands with the admiral and
nodding pleasantly to Billy Bowline. And
then with the admiral&rsquo;s hand upon his
shoulder, standing in the narrow, fast-darkening
street, Brydell told of Esdaile&rsquo;s disgrace
and of the terrible blow it was to poor Grubb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>His story was punctuated with explosions of
wrath from the admiral, such as &ldquo;Infamous
cad, the boy! Shoot me, but I&rsquo;d like to get
that young villain on a ship of mine! Why
didn&rsquo;t you lick him, sir? Why didn&rsquo;t you
lick him when you found the rascal out? Poor
old Grubb&mdash;one of the best men I ever knew;
ten good men like him will keep a whole ship&rsquo;s
company in order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy Bowline&rsquo;s indignation was expressed
by sundry snorts, sniffs, and angry hitchings
up of his trowsers, but was not the less emphatic
because not expressed in the admiral&rsquo;s
vigorous language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, sir,&rdquo; cried the admiral when
Brydell had finished his brief account. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to see Grubb with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The admiral mounted the rickety stairs with
his quick step, as alert as Brydell&rsquo;s. Billy
Bowline remained below because, as he whispered
to Brydell:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no love lost between sailors
and jirenes, and Grubb, he were the best
jirene I ever see; but I don&rsquo;t reckon as how
he keers about seein&rsquo; sailor men when he is in
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>After knocking at the door the admiral and
Brydell entered Grubb&rsquo;s little room. By the
light of the small lamp they could see him
distinctly, and he looked more gaunt, more
ashy, and nearer death than the evening before.
But he was feebly delighted to see them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this, Grubb?&rdquo; began the admiral
in his &ldquo;quarterdeck voice.&rdquo; &ldquo;You must get
up. You must get well. You were the best
orderly I ever had, and it never occurred to me
that you intended getting out of the service
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee, sir, for your good opinions,&rdquo; answered
Grubb, a light appearing in his sunken
eyes, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t git well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense. You&rsquo;ve had trouble
with your boy; but you must bear up&mdash;bear
up, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir, askin&rsquo; your pardon, you don&rsquo;t know
what it is to have trouble with your own flesh
and blood! I couldn&rsquo;t abear to be p&rsquo;inted out
as Grubb, the feller whose son was drove out of
his class for lyin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m a plain man, sir, and
maybe that&rsquo;s why I hold on to be respectable
so hard&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; else. I didn&rsquo;t
think, though, &rsquo;twould go so hard with me. I
made up my mind in a minute to git out o&rsquo; the
corps and take off this uniform as I respects
and loves. But I didn&rsquo;t think to fall down in
the street, and I know I&rsquo;ve got a shock as I&rsquo;ll
never get over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The admiral could not but believe him.
For three or four days Brydell and the admiral
went to see Grubb regularly, and so did
Dr. Wayne, and it was plain to the most
inexperienced eye that the marine was traveling
fast out of this world. At last one evening
about the usual hour of dusk, when Brydell
went in the room he saw that Grubb had
started on the great journey. His face was
slightly flushed and his eyes bright, and occasionally
his mind would wander.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a-waitin&rsquo; for you, Mr. Brydell,&rdquo;
he cried in a weak voice. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s two things
as I want done. One is, I want you to git that
little Bible out o&rsquo; my haversack hanging up
yonder and read them promises about them as
believes in Jesus Christ shall live though they
die. And the other is, to put my best uniform
on me. You see, sir, something&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
happen; it&rsquo;s a inspection, seems to me, but
my head ain&rsquo;t clear&mdash;yes, it&rsquo;s a inspection
sure. And Private Grubb ain&rsquo;t never been
reported at inspection in twenty-four, goin&rsquo; on
twenty-five years, as long as I&rsquo;ve been in the
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;d better wait until
the doctor comes, Grubb?&rdquo; asked Brydell
soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, no, sir! I&rsquo;ve got to be on time&mdash;there&rsquo;s
the bugle now, sir&rdquo;&mdash;and indeed a
faint echo of the bugle came through the
open windows from the Constellation lying
out in the harbor, half a mile away. He was
so insistent that Brydell went to the closet and
took out a new private&rsquo;s uniform that hung
there. He brought it to the bed and laid it
down. Grubb began to finger it, and his face
changed and his manner calmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what &rsquo;tis, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t
no inspection here on earth I&rsquo;m in for; it&rsquo;s
a inspection by the Great Captain as to how
we&rsquo;ve did our duty. But all the same, Mr.
Brydell, I want this here uniform on&mdash;because
I always said I wanted to die in it. Howsomever,
do you think it&rsquo;s right, as I might get
my discharge papers any day, for me to be
wearin&rsquo; it and bein&rsquo; buried in it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic1">
<img src="images/p3.jpg" alt="" width="996" height="682" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;BRYDELL GOT THE THUMBED BIBLE AND READ TO HIM.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anybody in the world would
call it wrong, Grubb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say that.
It does seem hard if, after I&rsquo;ve served twenty-four,
goin&rsquo; on twenty-five years, I&rsquo;m to die and
be buried like a plain cit.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> And I&rsquo;d like you
to ask the admiral as how if I couldn&rsquo;t have
the right sort of a funeral; you know we give
it to old Capps. I ain&rsquo;t set on the band particklar,
but I want the flag on my coffin, and I
want to be carried by my messmates. Now
will you ask the admiral all about this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Brydell in a trembling voice.
Then holding Grubb up by main force he
managed to get the uniform on him, the poor
fellow helping feverishly and showing unexpected
strength. When at last it was done
Brydell got the thumbed Bible and read to
him those promises of comfort to the dying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it, Mr. Brydell. Life&rsquo;s a
sort o&rsquo; puzzle to me. I don&rsquo;t know where my
boy got his bad ways from,&mdash;and I&rsquo;m afraid
he won&rsquo;t get over &rsquo;em,&mdash;but if ever you have
a chance, I want you to befriend him for the
sake of poor old Grubb. Ha! ha! What a
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
funny little shaver you were! I can see you
now, sir, the day I grabbed you for tearing up
the turf at the navy yard and the way you
banged away at me with that little rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was getting excited and beginning to
toss about on his narrow bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you had better keep quiet
and try to go to sleep? The doctor will be
here presently,&rdquo; said Brydell, trying to restrain
his tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, sir; good-night,&rdquo; answered
Grubb in a pleasant, natural voice.</p>
<p>In a little while the door opened softly and
the doctor walked in. He went up to the
bed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep, sir,&rdquo; said Brydell in a
whisper. The doctor bent over him and
listened for his breathing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is asleep,&rdquo; he said after a while.
&ldquo;He will wake no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Brydell told the admiral about Grubb&rsquo;s last
wish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be done, by George!&rdquo; cried the
admiral with tears in his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>So poor Grubb, after having served twenty-four,
going on twenty-five years, was buried in
his uniform and taken covered with the flag
to his last resting-place, and nobody asked a
word about his discharge papers; the admiral
arranged all that.</p>
<p>Behind the coffin of his humble friend
walked Brydell, in full uniform; and as he
kept the slow step of the funeral march
solemnly played by the band, he thought to
himself: &ldquo;This man was a poor uneducated
private, but I hope I shall be able to have as
good a report to give the Great Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN COMMAND OF THE SQUADRON.</span></h2>
<p>One night about seven years after this,
the handsome fifty-four gun frigate, the
Naiad, flagship of Admiral Beaumont&rsquo;s squadron,
and the sloops-of-war Vixen and Spitfire
lay at anchor off a town on the South American
coast.</p>
<p>The night was clear, although there was
no moon, and the harbor lights shone steadily.
The town itself was full of life and light, the
governor&rsquo;s castle blazed, and across the dark
water floated the inspiring music of several
military bands. A grand official reception in
honor of the admiral and his officers was in
progress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Walking the deck of the Naiad was Brydell,
now a handsome young ensign. He wore a
look of sublime resignation. He had a wholesome
appetite for receptions, but it being his
watch that night he was obliged to remain on
board. In vain had he made all sorts of
advantageous offers of exchanging duty with
the other young watch officers, of whom Maxwell,
his old acquaintance of the Constellation,
was one, and Cunliffe was another. Brydell
had pleaded, cajoled, and stormed; the other
fellows only laughed at him and went off to
enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look over there at the Spitfire,&rdquo;
growled Brydell to himself&mdash;the Spitfire was
commanded by Brydell&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;Dad hates
these affairs and has let all the fellows go
and stays at home and keeps ship himself. I
wish our captain was an unsocial widower
like dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as if to exasperate him further came
a burst of music from the shore, borne fitfully
over the water. Brydell glanced cynically up
at the frigate&rsquo;s lights which indicated by their
arrangement that both admiral and captain
were on shore, while the Spitfire, a short distance
off, although looming up indistinctly, yet
showed by the lanterns on her shadowy spars
that her captain was aboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; thought Brydell, slamming his
cap fiercely on his head, &ldquo;Admiral Beaumont is
nearer right than my father, for he gets all the
solid fun there is out of life. That&rsquo;s the sort
of admiral I mean to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell had enjoyed every moment of his
cruise on the flagship. It was Admiral Beaumont&rsquo;s
last sea service before his retirement.
They expected to sail for home within a few
days, and when the admiral hauled down his
flag it would be for good. He had been
known as a great martinet, but for the last
few weeks he had become rather more indulgent,
especially in the matter of shore leave;
and now, for the first time on the cruise, the
ship had on her only one lieutenant, Verdery;
one ensign, Brydell; two young naval cadets,
and one assistant engineer.</p>
<p>As Brydell walked the deck some strange
thoughts crossed his mind. They had that day
taken on board from the Vixen a number of men
whose time was up, and who were to be conveyed
back to the United States, while the
Vixen remained on the South Atlantic station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>And among them was a sailor rated on the
ship&rsquo;s books as &ldquo;William Black, able seaman,&rdquo;
whom Brydell instantly recognized, in spite of a
heavy full beard, as Esdaile. He had heard
nothing of Grubb&rsquo;s disgraced son in all those
seven years, and had thought that an American
man-of-war was the last place on earth to look
for him. But he concluded that Esdaile had
no doubt spent his little patrimony and had
probably enlisted for a living, failing in other
things.</p>
<p>Esdaile or Black had given no sign of
recognition, and probably hoped that his
altered name, his beard, and the changes of
seven years would keep his identity unknown.
The meeting had given Brydell a shock. He
had never forgotten his promise to poor Grubb
to befriend his son if possible, but he had had
no means of doing so.</p>
<p>Then his thoughts turned to pleasanter things.
He had received a letter from Minna Laurison
that day, enclosing her photograph in her white
commencement gown. She was a pretty girl
of seventeen then, and eager to enter college,
which she would do the next year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Brydell had been back to the Laurison place
several times since he had spent his year of
farm work there, and Minna and he had
continued fast friends. Minna, in her enthusiasm
for the higher education, was loftily
indifferent to receptions, never having been to
one; and Brydell made her very indignant and
amused himself very much by promising her
that her head would no doubt be completely
turned by the first she should go to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; thought Brydell to himself
as he walked up and down the deserted quarterdeck.
&ldquo;Some time or other I&rsquo;ll go to a more
gorgeous reception than this, and I&rsquo;ll have
a sweeter girl to take than any here&mdash;it will be
Minna Laurison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sea had been rough when the boats put
off, and it grew rougher as the wind suddenly
began to rise. Lieutenant Verdery, one of the
oldest lieutenants, who was left in command of
the ship, had gone forward for a few moments
and presently came back. The wind began
then to blow in earnest, and the big frigate
was rocking like a cockle shell. The sky, too,
became black and lowering in an inconceivably
short time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we were in for a
norther,&rdquo; said Verdery. &ldquo;We have had most
uncommon good weather for this coast, and it&rsquo;s
about time for it to change. I shouldn&rsquo;t be
surprised if the admiral got wet coming off
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he didn&rsquo;t get
off at all,&rdquo; answered Brydell, pointing to the
northwest.</p>
<p>A great mass of black clouds had collected
as if by magic, and at that instant it was torn by
a flash of forked green light that seemed to rend
the heavens. Nothing could have been more
sudden. Verdery dashed below to look at the
glass and to see the engineer, for if the storm
struck them, the safety of the ship and of the
four hundred men she carried would depend
upon the power of the engines to keep her
off the giant rocks that fringed the shore.</p>
<p>Almost instantly the distant roar of the
advancing tempest was heard, and in another
moment the cabin orderly came running up
excitedly to Brydell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mr. Verdery
was just going in the cabin to look at the glass
when, one of the ports being loose, the wind
blew it in and it struck Mr. Verdery right full
in the forehead and knocked him insensible.
The cabin steward run to him to do everything
he could, but Mr. Verdery can&rsquo;t give no orders,
and the steward, as was a hospital steward once,
says as how it was a pretty bad blow, and when
Mr. Verdery comes to, he can&rsquo;t give no orders
&rsquo;cause both his eyes is bleeding and he can&rsquo;t
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one moment Brydell&rsquo;s heart stood still.
He was the next officer in rank to Verdery on
board, the only others besides the assistant
engineer being Manning and Buxton, both
his juniors, and upon him would rest the
command of the flagship and her company
in a gale which promised to be a hurricane.
In another moment, though, his courage rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only do my best,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and
all my life and training has been steadily
toward making me fit for such an emergency;
and all I can do is to keep off shore and trust
in God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that very moment the advance guard of
the storm struck them. As they were at
anchor their canvas was secure, but their
steam was low, and the wind was driving
them straight on to destruction. The Naiad&rsquo;s
head had been pointed seaward, but as the
tempest struck her it knocked the great frigate
around as if it had been a paper ship, and her
heavy anchors began to drag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Call the boatswain!&rdquo; was Brydell&rsquo;s first
quick order, given calmly enough although
his heart was thumping like a steam engine,
and his next was, &ldquo;Call the signal man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another moment the sharp call of the
whistle was heard to get up the anchor, and
above the darkness the night signal went up to
the other ships, &ldquo;Up anchors and go to sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their only safety lay in seeking the open
ocean. Manning and Buxton were on deck
immediately, cool and composed. Crawford,
the young engineer, was at his post working
hard to get up steam, and in a few minutes
the throb of the engines, slow but steady, was
heard.</p>
<p>Brydell was at the wheel with Atkins, his
old acquaintance of his cadet days, who was
now a quartermaster and remarkably cool-headed
and reliable. The helm was put hard
aport, and in the teeth of the gale the ship
was brought about by slow degrees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>A black and blinding rain had come along
with thunder, lightning, and wind, and it was
only during the flashes of lightning that the
Vixen and the Spitfire could be seen. Both
sloops-of-war had more powerful engines for
their size and worked better than the Naiad.
As soon as the signal was sent up, Brydell saw
that both ships had come about and were heading
seaward for safety. They made but slow
progress, but still they were moving steadily and
passed close to the Naiad on the port quarter.
The Naiad was struggling with the fury of the
storm and, although her head had been brought
partly around, she lay in the trough of the sea,
her laboring engines seemingly unable to move
her against the force of the hurricane.</p>
<p>All her company were on deck except the
force down in the engine rooms, and the men
had begun to make silent preparation for the
fight for their lives. Most of them had kicked
off their shoes and stripped off their jackets,
expecting every moment to be engulfed in the
boiling sea.</p>
<p>Suddenly a flash of lightning that lasted
nearly a minute and played over the whole
heavens showed them the Spitfire, passing them
easily though slowly, followed by the Vixen.
Captain Brydell was standing on the bridge of
the Spitfire, and saw at a glance that Brydell
was in command. He at once surmised that
Lieutenant Verdery was disabled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>As he forged ahead of the flagship, Captain
Brydell took off his cap and waved it; and
Brydell, knowing the spirit of fortitude that
his father expected of him, waved his cap
back in that one moment of ghastly light.
Then, as the darkness descended, a cheer rang
out above the howling of the wind; it was the
men on the Naiad cheering their more fortunate
comrades, while they themselves seemed
doomed to destruction.</p>
<p>But at that moment the frigate, as if gathering
herself for a mighty effort, moved forward
a little, then stopped and staggered, and again
she was moving ahead, although but slowly and
unsteadily. Brydell managed to keep her head
to the wind, and by degrees as the steam got
up she made a little more headway.</p>
<p>In the blinding flashes of light they could
see the two sloops-of-war for a while ahead of
them, but when they had got a mile or two
from shore not even the lightning gleam could
pierce the whole of the awful darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Brydell&rsquo;s sensations as he stood by the wheel,
occasionally leaving it to mount the bridge for
a minute or two, could not be described. He
was simply doing what any other officer could
do or would have done, but no young officer in
the world, having for his first command the
safety of a flagship in a furious gale and the
lives of four hundred souls, could feel anything
but awed and solemn.</p>
<p>The quickness with which he had seized the
situation and had signaled the course to pursue
had inspired the men with confidence, and he
was well supported by the coolness and steadiness
of the young midshipmen. Presently,
while walking forward to see how things were
going, he was met by the cabin orderly, who in
attempting to salute lost his cap in the shrieking
wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Verdery, sir, has come to,&rdquo; he yelled in
Brydell&rsquo;s ear above the roaring of wind and
water, &ldquo;and the cabin steward is helpin&rsquo; him on
deck; but he can&rsquo;t see &rsquo;cause both his eyes
were hurt by that &rsquo;ere port blowin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the half-darkness that the ship&rsquo;s lights
could only pierce like star points Brydell saw
Verdery, with his eyes bandaged, being helped
up the companionway. Brydell hurried to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have done admirably, Mr. Brydell,&rdquo;
was Verdery&rsquo;s generous greeting, &ldquo;and it shall
be known to your credit. My first dread when
I recovered my senses was that you had not
grasped the situation, but when I asked I found
out that you had put to sea as promptly as any
officer could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I immediately signaled the other ships
to go to sea also,&rdquo; replied Brydell.</p>
<p>At that a sudden change came over Verdery&rsquo;s
pale and anxious face which was visible below
the bandages. In the midst of the horrors and
dangers of the hour he suddenly burst out
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right you were,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but your
father was in command of the Spitfire. I
wonder how he would have felt if he had known
it was you who ordered him to go outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did know it, sir,&rdquo; answered Brydell,
smiling faintly. &ldquo;They passed quite close to
us, and a great flash of light came, and I saw
my father as plainly as I see you now, and of
course he saw I was in command. He waved
his cap to me, and I waved mine back at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verdery, in spite of his dangerous hurt and
helpless condition, remained on deck, but he
gave no orders, nor did he find it necessary to
make any suggestions, and his presence was
only from the feeling that he wished to be found
at his post, even if he could not do duty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>The fury of the storm continued, but the
Naiad, with her engines revolving quickly, was
better able to withstand it. They had now
worked their way well out to sea and were in
fairly good condition to weather the gale.</p>
<p>Brydell, although absorbed in trying to save
the ship, had yet noticed Black, the seaman
whom he knew to be Esdaile. There was little
for the men to do, so they gathered forward on
the fok&rsquo;sle ready for any emergency.</p>
<p>Not so Black, who stood as far aft as discipline
would allow, and apart from his mates.
Just then the fury of the gale blew a part of
the main staysail out of the bolt ropes, and the
men sprang aloft to reef the ragged sail.</p>
<p>It was Black&rsquo;s duty to go and he went, but
Brydell, watching him in the half-light, saw
that he shirked his work. He was the last man
aloft, and he was so careless in what he was
doing that the captain of the maintop, pushing
him aside, secured the sail himself. Black
dropped to the deck unconcernedly, close
by Brydell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My man,&rdquo; said Brydell sharply, &ldquo;you must
be smarter at your duty than that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Without a word Black rushed at Brydell and
with one blow felled him to the deck; then, as
if maddened, he jumped on him and began
kicking him furiously. In an instant a dozen
brawny arms had seized the insubordinate sailor
and he was dragged below, fighting and resisting
violently.</p>
<p>Neither the blow nor the kicks had seriously
hurt Brydell. He was dazed by the suddenness
of it, but in half a minute he was on his
feet, none the worse but for a few bruises.
The men, seeing his escape and knowing how
much the safety of all on board depended on
the young ensign, with one accord gave him
three thundering cheers that echoed above the
roaring of the storm.</p>
<p>All night the tempest raved, and when a
ghastly dawn followed, the ship was still fighting
for her life. Brydell did not once leave the
deck, but toward noon the wind calmed, and
although the sea still ran high the fury of the
storm was over.</p>
<p>About two o&rsquo;clock in the day the Spitfire was
sighted. Brydell, knowing her superior speed,
signaled: &ldquo;Report us all right and we will be
in some time to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>The Spitfire signaled back: &ldquo;Congratulations.
Who commands?&rdquo; The answer came:
&ldquo;Ensign Brydell. Verdery hurt, but not
seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this good report the Spitfire steamed
away for the anchorage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A SAFE RETURN.</span></h2>
<p>Just at sunset that night the anxious group
of officers on the dock caught sight of the
smoke from the Naiad&rsquo;s funnels, and in a
little while the great frigate came in sight.
As she neared her anchorage in the sunset
glow they could see the scarcity of officers on
her decks; there were only Brydell, Manning,
and Buxton; for, although Verdery was
on deck, he was seated in a chair with his
eyes bound up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Admiral Beaumont to
his officers as the ship was hove to and
anchored in seamanlike style, &ldquo;yonder shows
what can be done by a lot of schoolboys
who know their duty and can do it. The
eldest of those young officers, young Brydell,
is scarcely more than a boy, yet he acted
with all the boldness and decision of a man,
and has done as well as you or I or any of
us could.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>And then a cheer went up from the crowds
on the dock, the admiral leading and waving
his cap enthusiastically. As soon as a boat
could be set off Admiral Beaumont, the captain,
and the officers went aboard.</p>
<p>When Brydell met them at the gangway he
was far from being the trim and fresh-looking
young fellow he had been twenty-four hours
before. His eyes were heavy from want of
sleep, and his face evidently needed washing.
His uniform had got wet and dried on him
without improving his appearance in the least.
But Admiral Beaumont saw none of this; he
only wrung Brydell&rsquo;s hand without speaking.
Brydell, with a flush rising in his wan face,
said, smiling:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No accidents, admiral, except Mr. Verdery&rsquo;s
with his eyes, and the surgeon says
that will not be serious, and one staysail
torn, but I think it can be mended.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Verdery, holding on to the surgeon&rsquo;s arm,
rose to shake hands with the admiral. &ldquo;And
I wish to tell you, sir,&rdquo; he said loudly so
everybody could hear him, &ldquo;that I was disabled
at the very beginning of the storm and
never gave an order, and the safety of the
ship and her company is due entirely to the
coolness, ability, and courage of Mr. Brydell,
who commanded through it all, and that of
the other officers acting under his orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell turned crimson; he had only done
his duty, and he felt ashamed to be made a
hero of in that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any other officer, I am sure, would have
done as well,&rdquo; he managed to stammer. &ldquo;Mr.
Crawford, Mr. Manning, Mr. Buxton&mdash;all did
equally well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said the admiral, smiling. &ldquo;It
is presumed that all officers do their duty
intelligently in an emergency, but it is very
great good fortune for a young officer to
have a chance for distinction, and to be equal
to the occasion, and I desire to express my
very great satisfaction at your conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other two young midshipmen and the
engineer were also highly praised, nor was
Verdery&rsquo;s admirable example in remaining on
deck forgotten, and the Naiad was indeed a
happy ship. And in a little while a boat was
seen pulling from the Spitfire, and in a few
minutes Captain Brydell stepped aboard the
Naiad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Brydell was so worn out with fatigue and
excitement that as soon as the captain resumed
command he would have gone below
at once except for the expectation of seeing
his father, but he waited for that. Captain
Brydell had meant to shake hands with him
formally in the presence of so many officers
and men, but before they knew it, almost,
father and son were in each other&rsquo;s arms.
The admiral took Brydell by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you go below
and go to sleep. Captain Brydell and I want
to hear all about the affair from someone who
observed your gallant conduct, and will do it
justice much more than you would&mdash;so go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell needed no second order. He went
below, and throwing himself, all dressed as
he was, upon his bunk, in five minutes was
sleeping like a log.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BRYDELL REDEEMS HIS PROMISE.</span></h2>
<p>When Brydell waked it was near daylight
next morning. His first thoughts were
confused and then the recollection of Black&rsquo;s
blow and the terrible consequences to a sailor
of striking an officer rushed to his mind. And
he remembered poor Grubb, his early friend,
and thought to himself: &ldquo;If I can do anything
for Esdaile, I will for Grubb&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was so troubled that he could sleep no
more, and dressed and went on deck very early.
As soon as the regular routine was gone
through, the admiral sent for him into the
cabin, where he asked an exact account of
everything, especially in regard to Black&rsquo;s
attack on him.</p>
<p>Brydell at once told him that he felt convinced
Black was Esdaile. This troubled Admiral Beaumont
as it had troubled Brydell. He had sincerely
respected poor Grubb, and the spectacle
of his boy&rsquo;s downfall was a painful one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have issued an order this morning for a
court-martial, and you will probably be the
first witness called,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admiral,&rdquo; said Brydell after a moment, &ldquo;I
would like your permission to see Black; I
don&rsquo;t care anything for him, but I promised
my poor old friend to do what I could for his
son, and I&rsquo;d like to tell him that I haven&rsquo;t any
animosity toward him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The admiral gave his permission and Brydell
went below to the dark place where Black
was in irons. He was sitting up with a scowl
on his face, and even in the dim light of the
gruesome place Brydell saw that it was Esdaile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to see you here,&rdquo; said he when
the marine on guard had turned his back.
&ldquo;The more so that I believe your father was
a man I loved very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Esdaile, if that is what you mean,&rdquo;
answered the supposed Black coolly. &ldquo;Of
course I&rsquo;ve gone to the dogs, driven to it by
being driven out of my class. My money
went a long time ago, and as I knew no way
of making a living but by shipping before the
mast, here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Brydell said not a word, but the thought of
poor Grubb, his simple honesty, his mistaken
indulgence to his boy, his enduring poverty,
and privation all his life for this boy almost
overcame him. Esdaile, watching Brydell&rsquo;s
face, saw he was deeply moved, and so touching
is the sight of magnanimity and sympathy
that few hearts can withstand it. Esdaile&rsquo;s
could not.</p>
<p>After a few moments he broke the painful
pause, saying hesitatingly and with something
like a sob between his words, &ldquo;And when I
saw you standing there last night, an officer,
and with such a chance for distinction, I
couldn&rsquo;t help hating you; and when you spoke
to me sharply about my duty, I went crazy, I
believe, and struck you. Now I suppose I&rsquo;ll
have five or ten years in prison and after that
I&rsquo;ll take my choice between the workhouse and
the jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell, like most courageous and upright
men, had a tender heart, and the words of the
man before him, scarcely a year older than himself,
gave him a powerful shock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear you talk in that way,&rdquo; he
said after a moment; &ldquo;but I want to tell you
this&mdash;that although I shall have to tell exactly
what happened before the court-martial, I can&rsquo;t
find in my heart the least feeling of revenge
against poor old Grubb&rsquo;s son, and when you
are let out of prison, if you&rsquo;ll come to me, I&rsquo;ll
do what I can for you, because I promised him
when he was dying&rdquo;&mdash;Brydell paused, and
a slight change came over Esdaile&rsquo;s face at
this, but he said nothing and Brydell turned
away.</p>
<p>The next day but one the court met, and it
made short work with Esdaile. The testimony
was complete, and the offence of striking an
officer, under the circumstances, was almost as
grave as if it were in time of war.</p>
<p>When Brydell was called upon for his evidence
he gave it in a plain and straightforward
way, and his examination brought out the fact
that the alleged Black was the son of Grubb the
marine, who had been known to one or two of
the older officers in the court. Brydell could not
but make the best showing he could for Esdaile,
and something in Esdaile&rsquo;s face seemed to indicate
that a humanizing process was going on
within him. It was indeed the turning point in
his life. Before that he had not fully realized
the wrongdoing of his whole life, but finding
himself on trial for a charge that must send him
to prison, gave him some awful moments of
reflection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Only a day or two were consumed in the
trial. Every time that Brydell saw Esdaile led
forward to his place to be tried for what was in
military morals and discipline a terrible offence,
it gave him a feeling of agony. He thought of
his kind old friend, and the tears would come
into his eyes in spite of himself. Esdaile was
singularly cool and behaved civilly and respectfully
to the court.</p>
<p>At last the verdict was given out&mdash;five
years in prison. Everybody was surprised at
its leniency. Esdaile when called up for
sentence was asked if he had anything to
say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only this, if you please, gentlemen,&rdquo; he
answered calmly, in the tone and manner of an
educated man. &ldquo;The time was when Mr.
Brydell and I were not so unequal in our
standing. I made a mistake, committed a fault,
if you will, in my early youth, that has made
me what I am. I had not seen Mr. Brydell
since; we had both of us been youths together.
On the night of the storm I stood apart from
my mates, watching him and envying him.
Here, thought I, is he&mdash;an officer, suddenly
finding himself in the position to reap the
greatest credit, with the admiral, the captain,
and all the officers in the squadron to witness
it, while I, a sailor before the mast, forced to
conceal my real name, poor and friendless,
might have been where he is. And when I went
aloft I scarcely knew what I was doing. When
I came down on deck he spoke to me; I believe
he acknowledged that he spoke impatiently,
and some devil seemed to rise up in me, and I
would have killed him if I could. But that has
all passed. I have been tried fairly and impartially,
and all I can ask is the mercy of the
court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of a deep and breathless silence
the verdict was read&mdash;five years in prison.
Esdaile, still wearing his impassive look, neither
groaned nor fell as men sometimes do in his
awful circumstances; he only said after a painful
pause of a few minutes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank the court for its very moderate
punishment, and I should like the favor of
seeing Mr. Brydell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Brydell was hastily sent for. He had purposely
kept out of the way; the sight of
Esdaile&rsquo;s misery was terrible to him. He was
found though, and at once came in response to
the summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brydell,&rdquo; said Esdaile in the same composed
and reasonable voice, &ldquo;I have received
my sentence and nothing I may say or do now
can mitigate it. You will therefore think me
sincere when I ask your pardon for my conduct,
and tell you that if I live to get out of prison I
will lead a different life. Won&rsquo;t you shake
hands with me, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brydell, choking with emotion, held out his
hand and, for the first time in the lives
of the two young men, they met in mutual
goodwill.</p>
<p>It was now time for the Naiad to sail for
home, and Esdaile had to be taken back in her
before he was consigned to prison. He was
kept in solitary confinement and treated rigorously
but not unkindly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Brydell asked permission of the admiral to
go to Esdaile&rsquo;s cell every day for a few minutes.
They would talk together, and Brydell began to
see that Esdaile was indeed a changed man.
These visits became the one bright spot in
Esdaile&rsquo;s hard life, and when at last the ship
reached New York he felt that he had at least
one friend in the world.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>One night some years after that Brydell,
now one of the brightest lieutenants in the
navy, sat in his pleasant quarters writing. His
wife sat near him under a softly shaded lamp,
reading. After a long silence, broken only by
the scratching of Brydell&rsquo;s pen, he turned to
her and handed her a paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read that, Minna,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Esdaile, I
believe, is a reformed man. These people will
give him a place as bookkeeper, but as he told
them frankly his past history, they write me
that if I will go on Esdaile&rsquo;s bond for five thousand
dollars they will take him. I don&rsquo;t
believe there is the slightest danger; his fault,
you know, was not connected with money; but
I don&rsquo;t think it right for any man to assume
this sort of responsibility without his wife&rsquo;s
consent. So it rests with you whether I shall
guarantee Esdaile or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Minna took the letter and read it carefully.
Then handing it back said softly: &ldquo;Of course
you must sign it. Didn&rsquo;t you promise the
poor marine when he was dying that you
would befriend his boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you who are befriending him now,&rdquo;
answered Brydell. &ldquo;Whenever a man is saved
there is always a good woman who has a share
in it. Between us we will redeem my promise
to dear old Grubb. Here goes!&rdquo; And Brydell
signed the letter.</p>

<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ON BOARD THE DIOMEDE.</span></h2>
<p>At sunset, on a wild January afternoon in
1776, the Diomede frigate passed Beaver-Tail
light and entered the harbor of Newport.
At that time the town was held by a large
British fleet and land force.</p>
<p>The Diomede was a crack frigate and evidently
had a crack crew from the beautiful
precision with which she made a flying moor.
It seemed as if in one minute her yards
were squared, her sails furled, and her cable
rushed out of the hawse hole in a blaze of
sparks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>All this was done under the orders of the
Diomede&rsquo;s commander, Captain Forrester,
who, being one of the best seamen in the
British navy, liked to show his skill in anchoring
before the assembled fleet. As soon as
everything was made snug the captain went
below and, seating himself at the cabin table,
began to examine some papers by the light of
the swinging lamp. He had a kindly, frank
face, which was an index to a kindly, frank
nature.</p>
<p>After reading and writing for a while he
called to the orderly who stood at the cabin
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Direct the master-at-arms to bring me the
man and the boy taken prisoners on the brig
Betsey,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The orderly disappeared and a few minutes
later the master-at-arms marched in with a
remarkably handsome old sailor of about sixty
and a boy of ten or twelve.</p>
<p>As soon as the old sailor saw the captain, he
touched his glazed hat with prompt civility and
in a way very suggestive of a naval man,
although he wore the rough pea jacket of a
merchant sailor.</p>
<p>Captain Forrester motioned to the master-at-arms
to leave him alone with the two prisoners.
As soon as the master-at-arms&rsquo; back was
turned, the captain said to the old sailor:
&ldquo;Shut the door, Bell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; answered Bell in a tone and
manner of deference clearly never learned in the
merchant service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see I know your name,&rdquo; continued
Captain Forrester, looking at him keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the old sailor slyly, with
something suspiciously near a smile; &ldquo;Bell
ain&rsquo;t a uncommon name, and I once knowed a
midshipman named Forrester, sir; a mighty
smart little reefer he was, too, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time it was the captain&rsquo;s turn to smile
when he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man Bell that I knew was an American,
but he had spent most of his life in His Majesty&rsquo;s
service&mdash;Jack Bell he was&mdash;captain of the
mizzentop when I was midshipman on the
Indomptable, and captain of the maintop when
I was sailing master on the old Colossus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Bell&rsquo;s eyes gleamed as the captain
spoke, and there was an answering gleam in
the captain&rsquo;s eyes. The tie that unites good
shipmates is a strong one, no matter how great
the difference in rank; and the old sailor&rsquo;s
delight at being recognized, although it might
mean trouble for him, was evident.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>The captain remembered that in his reefer
days, when as a mere lad he was ordered to
command a boat&rsquo;s crew, that Jack Bell had
always been orderly, respectful, and sober, and
had helped him out of not a few scrapes, and
had occasionally got him into some.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first time I ever went aloft,&rdquo; said
the captain, smiling involuntarily, &ldquo;Jack Bell
was in the mizzentop, and I recollect my feelings
when I was ready to go down, and Jack
held on to me, insisting I should pay my
footing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten shillings it were, sir,&rdquo; chimed in Jack
with a broad grin. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what was axed
reg&rsquo;lar of the reefers on the old Indomptable,
and many&rsquo;s the shilling you&rsquo;ve give me
besides&mdash;I&mdash;I mean&mdash;you give that &rsquo;ere Jack
Bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack stopped, wholly confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that Jack Bell was a famous singer.
Many a night when the ship was going along
under easy sail with a fair wind, I have sat for
hours listening to Jack&rsquo;s sea songs, like &lsquo;Tom
Bowline,&rsquo; &lsquo;When the Wind at Night Whistles
o&rsquo;er the Deep,&rsquo; and all those fine old catches.
I never heard anybody sing them so well as he.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;His voice is badly cracked now, sir,&rdquo; said
Jack solemnly, &ldquo;but this &rsquo;ere little brat Dicky
Stubbs can sing all them old songs&mdash;Jack
Bell l&rsquo;arned &rsquo;em to him. But, Jack, he remembers
that &rsquo;ere little midshipman Forrester&mdash;and
a gallant officer, sir, he turned out to be arterwards&mdash;when
he was sailin&rsquo; master on the Colossus.
Did you ever see, sir, such a ornhandy
ship for tackin&rsquo; as the old Colossus? If Mr.
Forrester hadn&rsquo;t been a rale sailor, he&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; got
hisself in trouble all the time with that old
three-decker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Forrester knew this was honest
praise from an honest man, and it pleased him
more than many fine words from fine people.
After a moment Jack continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Axin&rsquo; your parding, sir, there&rsquo;s a midshipman
on this &rsquo;ere ship as is named Mr. Forrester.
I never see a young gentleman so like that
other midshipman Forrester as I knowed
more &rsquo;n twenty-five year ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my son&mdash;my only child&mdash;and a
smart fellow, if I do say it myself. But I want
to hear something about Jack Bell. The man
I knew was a devoted American. I wonder
what he did when the colonies rebelled against
His Majesty?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Jack twiddled his cap awkwardly for a moment,
glanced around and saw the door was
shut, and then began to speak. His manner
was respectful and not without a rude and
simple eloquence of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Forrester, that man Jack Bell wanted
for to do his duty. He had tooken the oath to
King George when he &rsquo;listed in the navy and
had served him stiddy for more &rsquo;n forty year.
But that man, Cap&rsquo;n Forrester, sir, was a American,
and when that there Congress at Philadelphy
said Ameriky was free and independent,
Jack Bell, he were in a peck o&rsquo; trouble. There
was his oath o&rsquo; allegiance to King George
starin&rsquo; him in the face, and there were the heart
and soul o&rsquo; him tellin&rsquo; him he were a villain to
fight ag&rsquo;in his own country. Well, sir, Bell,
not bein&rsquo; a eddicated man, couldn&rsquo;t think out
easy what was right for him to do&mdash;&rsquo;cause that
man, sir, wanted for to do his duty. But he
knowed if he had suspicioned King George
was a-goin&rsquo; to declare war ag&rsquo;in Ameriky, Bell,
he&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; never tooken that oath; so at last he
thought it was his duty to desert.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>The old sailor paused slightly at this word,
and the officer and the former captain of the
maintop looked each other squarely in the eye.
The boy Dicky Stubbs, who had a bright
glance, gazed first at one and then at the
other, wondering what it all was about. After
a little pause Jack Bell continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, that man Bell had a considerable
sum o&rsquo; prize money due him, but he
thought as how he&rsquo;d ruther not take it, as he
was goin&rsquo; to take French leave; so he give
that up willin&rsquo; and cheerful. And he knowed,
too, if he were caught, he&rsquo;d be strung up at
the yardarm in spite of his havin&rsquo; served King
George for more &rsquo;n forty years faithful; but he
thought he couldn&rsquo;t die but oncet for his country,
and it didn&rsquo;t matter much which way he
went, if only he was a-doin&rsquo; of his duty. So one
night at Gibralty, Jack Bell disappeared from
his ship&mdash;&rsquo;twas a ship o&rsquo; the line. Maybe
the Don Spaniards garroted him; maybe he
was tooken by pirates; maybe he got on a
American merchant vessel that was took arterwards
by the British, who thought she was
a privateer. Anyhow Jack Bell did what he
thought was right, and if he&rsquo;s got to be
hanged for it, well, that&rsquo;s a easy, comfortable
way o&rsquo; gittin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; the world, and Jack Bell
ain&rsquo;t got no apologies to make, excep&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;and
here the old sailor&rsquo;s voice deepened&mdash;&ldquo;excep&rsquo;
for not desertin&rsquo; sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>All this time the officer and the sailor had
looked steadily at each other. Captain Forrester
knew perfectly well that the man before
him was Jack Bell, and, if openly recognized,
there would be but a short step for him from
the fok&rsquo;sle of the Diomede to the whip<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> at the
yardarm. But Captain Forrester also believed
Jack had acted from his conscience, and he did
not believe in hanging a man for that. After a
pause the captain spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it is as hard for an educated
man as for an uneducated one to know on which
side his duty lies; but it is safer to be on the
side of mercy. If I should meet Bell, I should
not feel obliged to know him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Jack stood upright at &ldquo;attention&rdquo;
and saluted the captain. Each knew what that
meant. It was Jack&rsquo;s way of thanking the
captain, who knew him perfectly well, for not
betraying him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing, though, my conscience
would require me to do if I should meet Bell,&rdquo;
continued Captain Forrester. &ldquo;It is to land
him here where he can be watched, that he can&rsquo;t
get away to enlist in the rebel navy, army, or
marine corps. If King George can&rsquo;t have his
services, the rebels sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face was a study in its intense disappointment,
but in a little while he seemed to
submit to the inevitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s pretty old now&mdash;goin&rsquo;
on to sixty&mdash;and he ain&rsquo;t wuth his
salt, excep&rsquo; as a foremast man on a man-o&rsquo;-war.
So neither King George nor Ameriky ain&rsquo;t
losin&rsquo; much. He&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; liked to jine the navy,
but as for the marines, poor Jack Bell wouldn&rsquo;t
trust hisself with them murderin&rsquo; marines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jack Bell I know always hated the
marines,&rdquo; said Captain Forrester with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he do still,&rdquo; calmly remarked Jack.
&ldquo;And as for fightin&rsquo; on dry land&mdash;why, sir,
he&rsquo;d git so tired runnin&rsquo; about he never could
do no fightin&rsquo;. Landsmen instid o&rsquo; fightin&rsquo; at
close quarters fights over forty or fifty acres and
does more walkin&rsquo; than fightin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Captain Forrester, &ldquo;to
leave Jack Bell and come to your own affairs.
When I land you to-morrow morning I shall
ask the authorities to give you the run of the
town of Newport, but not to let you go outside.
I think I can contrive it through the
admiral, who is my friend. And how about
this youngster here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That brat, axin&rsquo; your parding, sir, is the son
o&rsquo; the Widow Stubbs at Newport&mdash;a excellent
woman, and a good hand at book-larnin&rsquo;, as
well as at the spinnin&rsquo; wheel. Her husband
was killed in one o&rsquo; the fust scrimmages o&rsquo; the
war, and this &rsquo;ere brat, he run away to jine the
&rsquo;Merican navy and was took on the Betsey
along with me. I knowed his mother well, and
I&rsquo;ve kinder kep&rsquo; my eye on the young one.
He is a right handy sort o&rsquo; boy, and he can
sing a lot o&rsquo; chunes I&rsquo;ve larned him. He
can sing all the old songs and two or three
&lsquo;Tid re I&rsquo;s&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve set him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipe up, youngster,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to hear one of the old songs again. Give
me &lsquo;When the Wind at Night Whistles o&rsquo;er
the Deep.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Dicky Stubbs looked scared to death.
His mouth came open, but no sound issued.
Jack Bell, giving him a nudge that nearly broke
his ribs, whispered:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear the cap&rsquo;n tell you to
pipe up, you mutinous brat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus adjured, Dicky began in a deliciously
sweet but rather uncertain voice:<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When the wind at night whistles o&rsquo;er the deep</p>
<p class="t">And sings to landsmen dreary,</p>
<p class="t0">The sailor, fearless, goes to sleep</p>
<p class="t">Or takes his watch most cheery.</p>
<p class="t4">Snoozing here,</p>
<p class="t4">Tossing there,</p>
<p class="t4">Steadily, readily,</p>
<p class="t4">Cheerily, merrily,</p>
<p class="t0">Still from care and thinking free,</p>
<p class="t0">Is a sailor&rsquo;s life at sea.</p>
</div>
<p>Before he reached the third line Dicky&rsquo;s
courage, and his voice too, returned and he
sang like some sweet-throated bird the next
verse:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When the ship, d&rsquo;ye see, becomes a wreck,</p>
<p class="t">And landsmen hoist the boat, sir,</p>
<p class="t0">The sailor scorns to quit the deck</p>
<p class="t">While there&rsquo;s a single plank afloat, sir.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Captain Forrester, leaning his head on his
hand, listened to the song that carried him
back to his midshipman days, and watched the
boy whose young fresh voice echoed through
the low-pitched cabin. Dicky was unmistakably
a child of the people, but his honest face,
his bright, intelligent eyes, and his clean
though ragged attire made him a prepossessing
little fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may go now,&rdquo; said Captain Forrester to
Jack Bell, and meanwhile giving Dicky a bright
shilling, &ldquo;but do not forget what I have told
you, and also that you have got off very well.
As for that lad, take him to his mother and tell
her to keep him at home until he has cut his
wisdom teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye kindly, sir,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
not forget your orders, sir, and as long as I
live I&rsquo;ll not forget your kindness, sir.&rdquo; And,
with a parting salute, Jack returned to the custody
of the waiting master-at-arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A GALLANT RESCUE.</span></h2>
<p>The next morning ushered in a blustering
day, and the wind blew so hard as to
make it decidedly uncomfortable for small boats
in the harbor.</p>
<p>In the forenoon a boat was lowered from the
Diomede to take Jack Bell and Dicky Stubbs
ashore. Captain Forrester had seen the admiral,
and had got permission to let Jack Bell
remain at Newport in a merely nominal imprisonment,
upon the ground of the old sailor&rsquo;s
age; and with many thanks Jack bade the
captain good-by and got in the boat, with
Dicky after him.</p>
<p>The boat was commanded by young Forrester,
the captain&rsquo;s son, and so like his father
that Jack felt as if he had turned back many
pages of his life, and it was the Midshipman
Forrester of twenty-five years ago before him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s gig had put off from the ship
with the captain, bound ashore, and was far
behind the midshipman&rsquo;s boat. The young
midshipman steered straight for the landing-place,
but he knew nothing of the tides and currents
of the harbor. The fierce wind was against
them, and he suddenly found the boat too close
to the shore, and fast nearing a ledge of sunken
rocks, around which the waves were boiling.
As he half-rose from his seat the boat lurched
violently and he suddenly lost his balance;
in another moment he was jerked overboard
and disappeared. A cry went up from every
man in the boat except Jack Bell. It was not a
mere everyday fall overboard, but a fall amid
sharp-pointed rocks and dangerous eddies.
Before the echo of that cry had died over the
water, Jack Bell had kicked off his shoes,
peeled off his jacket, and had plunged into the
icy water after the young midshipman.</p>
<p>Every movement was plain to Captain Forrester
in his gig, only a short distance away;
and his crew, in a moment, pulled furiously
toward the other boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Jack Bell had dived exactly over the spot
where young Forrester had disappeared. In a
minute or two he came up, but alone. At this
the agonized father covered his face and
groaned. But after a few long breaths Jack
dived again. This time when he rose a great
shout went up&mdash;he had young Forrester in his
arms.</p>
<p>In another minute he was in the boat, which
headed for the nearest shore, closely followed
by the captain&rsquo;s gig. Just above where they
landed was a lonely little cottage, and as soon
as the keel touched the sand two powerful
sailors seized the unconscious young midshipman
and, led by Jack Bell and followed by
Dicky Stubbs, rushed up the steep incline
toward the cottage.</p>
<p>Captain Forrester was not far behind, but
when he reached the cottage the little midshipman&rsquo;s
clothes had been stripped from him,
Jack Bell was vigorously rolling, rubbing, and
pounding him, while Dicky Stubbs and his
mother&mdash;for it was the Widow Stubbs&rsquo; plain
cottage&mdash;were wringing out hot cloths to put
on young Forrester. Just as Captain Forrester
entered, the young midshipman gave a loud
gasp and opened his eyes, only to close them
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right, sir,&rdquo; cheerily called out Jack
Bell, not stopping in his rubbing. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s wuth
all the dead reefers betwixt Newport and Chiny.
He got a whack on his head from some o&rsquo; them
jagged rocks, and he just fainted like&mdash;but
he&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo; to fast, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would not have been here to come to
at all if it had not been for you, my friend,&rdquo;
said the captain in a choking voice.</p>
<p>Jack Bell said nothing,&mdash;he was too busy,&mdash;and
the captain, seeing the color return to his
boy&rsquo;s face, and that he was breathing better at
every moment, sat and watched with longing
eyes his return to life. The Widow Stubbs
was as useful in her way as Jack Bell, while
Dicky seemed to have six hands and four legs,
he was so helpful.</p>
<p>In half an hour the young fellow was laid in
the widow&rsquo;s plain though clean bed, and, except
a little weakness, was as well as ever he was in
his life, and was carried on board the Diomede
that very afternoon. The story of Jack Bell&rsquo;s
plunge into the surf for him was known on
board, and from that hour Jack was safe from
being denounced as a deserter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>The fact that he was born in America had
already deprived his offence of the moral guilt
that would have attached to it. It was common
enough for British sailors to be pressed
into the service of Spanish and French ships
when captured on merchant vessels, but there
was an unwritten law that they should desert
the first chance they had. This rule applied
perfectly to Jack Bell, and his plucky dive after
a young British officer secured for him that his
past should be universally winked at among the
officers and sailors at Newport who might recognize
him.</p>
<p>That same night Captain Forrester came
ashore and went straight to the Widow Stubbs&rsquo;
cottage, where he felt certain he would meet
the three persons he most desired to see there.</p>
<p>Sure enough, on opening the door he found
the widow, Jack Bell, and the boy Dicky sitting
before a blazing hickory fire in the humble
living-room. The widow sat at her spinning
wheel in one corner, and the wheel hummed
merrily. They were so poor they could not
afford even a tallow dip, but the fire made the
tidy little place quite bright and cheery. Jack
Bell sat on the wooden settle, and curled up by
him was Dicky Stubbs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Dicky had just been displaying his new accomplishments
in the singing line, and the
Widow Stubbs had swelled with pride at the
display of Dicky&rsquo;s talents. It was happiness
enough to get him back alive and well, but to
find him so grown, so much improved from the
ragged urchin who had run away, and with
such a wonderful new gift of singing, made the
Widow Stubbs an uncommonly happy woman.</p>
<p>They all rose as Captain Forrester entered,
and the widow gave him her only armchair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come to thank you all for my son&rsquo;s
life,&rdquo; said Captain Forrester as soon as he was
seated, &ldquo;but especially Jack Bell, here, who
risked his own life in jumping overboard among
the rocks for my son. Of course I never can
pay you for it&mdash;but here is something that at
least may give you some comforts;&rdquo; and the
captain took from his breast a small package
made up of golden sovereigns banded together
and held it toward Jack Bell.</p>
<p>Jack, however, shook his head and folded
his arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thank &rsquo;ee, sir, most respectful for &rsquo;em, and
I don&rsquo;t mean to hurt your feelin&rsquo;s by refusin&rsquo;;
but I can&rsquo;t take money for savin&rsquo; anybody&rsquo;s life&mdash;and
leastways from you, Cap&rsquo;n Forrester&mdash;as
was&rdquo;&mdash; Jack Bell paused, smiled knowingly,
and then continued: &ldquo;This &rsquo;ere boy sings a
song called &lsquo;Old Shipmates.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; answered the captain, smiling
back and knowing that Jack meant that he and
the captain had been shipmates; &ldquo;but think
of the pleasure you would give me to know
that this little present would make your old
age comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, sir,&rdquo; answered Jack; &ldquo;but I ain&rsquo;t
used to livin&rsquo; on my money, and I&rsquo;d be a sight
happier if I had sumpin&rsquo; to do, like bein&rsquo; a
night watchman or some sich thing. You see,
sir, I has had a watch now for more &rsquo;n forty
year, and it seems so ornnateral for me to git
into a standin&rsquo; bed place and know I ain&rsquo;t got
to hear the boatswain&rsquo;s call when it&rsquo;s time to
turn out, that I can&rsquo;t sleep a wink. Now it
seems to me, sir, as if I had a watch on shore
I could walk up and down this &rsquo;ere town callin&rsquo;
out the hours, and it would seem like I was
standin&rsquo; my reg&rsquo;lar watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But couldn&rsquo;t you stand watch on shore, as
you call it, just as well if you knew you had
a little money put away?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not for savin&rsquo; a life, sir,&rdquo; answered Jack as
politely as ever; but the captain knew then
there was no hope of his taking the money.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d be so kind, sir, as to git me the place
as watchman, I wouldn&rsquo;t ax no better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall certainly have a watchman&rsquo;s
place,&rdquo; said the captain, who mentally added,
&ldquo;if I have to pay your wages out of my own
pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem mightily like the lookout,&rdquo;
continued Jack evidently tickled with his new
scheme. &ldquo;I dessay I&rsquo;d forgit and call out:
&lsquo;Eight bells! Bright light, weather cathead!&rsquo;
instid o&rsquo; &lsquo;Twelve o&rsquo;clock, and all&rsquo;s well!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain laughed at this and then turned
to the Widow Stubbs:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, madam, and your son&mdash;will you
not permit me to give you some little token of
gratitude for your help in restoring my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Widow Stubbs blushed at this, but, like
Jack Bell, she had scruples about taking any
recompense for the saving of life, especially
as she was a woman of some education and
stood a little higher in the world than Jack
Bell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I thank you; but I could not
accept money from anyone. What I did was
very little, and what my boy did was still less.
I am glad, though, we were able to do that
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain felt disappointed when he put
his money back in his breast pocket, but he
was too much the gentleman to insist on these
humble people receiving what they felt themselves
above taking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; he said, looking toward
Dicky&rsquo;s round, bright face, &ldquo;I might be able
to do something for your boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid not,&rdquo; answered the widow with
a faint smile. &ldquo;We are patriots&mdash;my boy and
I; my husband was killed only six months ago
in the Continental Army, and there is nothing
that a British officer could do for him, no
matter how kindly meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do with him at
present?&rdquo; asked Captain Forrester.</p>
<p>The widow shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just got him back after he ran away.
I have not had time to think; but there is
always work hereabouts for a good strong boy
like Dicky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided he does not run away again,&rdquo; said
Captain Forrester.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Dicky turned a rosy red at finding himself
the subject of conversation and astonished his
mother by stuttering out,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P-p-please, sir, don&rsquo;t the British ever give
folks their parole? I&mdash;I mean, let &rsquo;em&mdash;go&mdash;if
they promise they won&rsquo;t do so any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Widow Stubbs heard this with surprise
and indignation. She had been much distressed
when Dicky had run away to join the
Continental navy, although he never got farther
than the merchant ship Betsey; but his
apparent eagerness to promise he would not
do so any more struck her as a want of spirit
in the boy that mortified her keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dicky Stubbs!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and
said no more for very shame of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we take paroles,&rdquo; said Captain Forrester,
supposing Dicky knew it referred only
to officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; cried Dicky, whose ideas of a
parole were very hazy, &ldquo;all I&rsquo;ve got to say is
that I don&rsquo;t want no parole,&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t take
it if you was to offer it to me,&mdash;and I ain&rsquo;t
going to give no promise about not running
away again. Just as soon as I am big enough
to carry my father&rsquo;s musket I&rsquo;m a-going to
enlist in the &rsquo;Merican army under General
Washington, and it won&rsquo;t be long before I do
it, neither!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>This sudden outbreak was followed by the
Widow Stubbs clasping Dicky in her arms and
crying,&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my own boy!&rdquo; while Jack Bell
said &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; under his breath.</p>
<p>But Captain Forrester, instead of sternly
calling upon Dicky to recant, as Dicky hoped,
who meant to hurl defiance at him, only laughed.
Dicky could have cried with rage and disappointment
when the captain got up, still laughing,
and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Washington will gain a valuable
recruit, and King George a dangerous enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse him,&rdquo; said the widow,
smiling, but a little ashamed of Dicky&rsquo;s forwardness;
&ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t mean to be impudent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;He is a lad
of spirit, and I like that kind. I will now bid
you good evening with a thousand thanks for
your kindness to my son; and if you get in
any trouble with that youngster of yours, write
to General Prescott and mention my name;
and as for you, Bell, the less we say about the
days on the Indomptable and the old Colossus,
the better, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Jack Bell grinned broadly at that and answered:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knowed, sir, you wouldn&rsquo;t blow the gaff
on a old shipmate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, then,&rdquo; said Captain Forrester.
&ldquo;You shall be made a watchman; and remember,
if you get in any trouble you must manage
to communicate with me; but I hope that prosperity
may attend all of you, whom I can never
forget and must always feel grateful to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Widow Stubbs made a low bow, Jack
Bell saluted, and Dicky, getting a lantern,
lighted the captain to his boat, which lay at
the foot of the cliff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DICKY&rsquo;S PATRIOTISM.</span></h2>
<p>Jack Bell very promptly got his appointment
as a watchman, and soon every night
he paraded the streets of Newport with a stick
and a lantern, calling out the hours as the night
slipped away. He never could bring himself,
though, to calling as the other watchmen did,&mdash;the
hour, and then, &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well!&rdquo;&mdash;but sung
out every half-hour the time according to the
ship&rsquo;s bells, always adding what the weather
was, and where the wind lay, such as, &ldquo;Six bells!
Wind sou&rsquo;-sou&rsquo;-east!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The townspeople soon got used to the old
sailor&rsquo;s way and he was not molested in his
peculiar ideas of the time. At all events, evil
characters who prowled by night had great
respect for him after having once felt the force
of his stick, because in spite of his age Jack&rsquo;s
arm was still stalwart, and he was not given to
arguing with offenders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>At that time there was a large British fleet
under Admiral Wallace lying off Newport,
besides a large land force under General Prescott.
It was impossible for Jack not to have a
great many more acquaintances than he desired
among the sailors of the fleet. But although
his true story was more than suspected, it was
perfectly well known that he had a powerful
protector in Captain Forrester. Jack&rsquo;s bold
dive into the icy water had turned out a good
thing for him. So Jack walked his beat all
night, and went back at daylight to the Widow
Stubbs&rsquo; cottage where he slept in the loft until
midday, and was as little unhappy as he could
be on shore.</p>
<p>The Widow Stubbs had spoken quite confidently
to Captain Forrester of Dicky&rsquo;s capacity
to make a living, but it turned out not so easy
as she fancied in spite of the fact that Dicky
was strong and bright and willing to work.
But he was only a twelve-year-old boy, and the
war times made business of all sorts dull.
Dicky worked around the wharves, but there
were scarcely any merchant vessels plying, and
the waterfront was almost deserted except by
the British warships and crews.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>The Americans held the opposite shore of
Narragansett Bay, and Dicky imagined that on
fine days he could see the American flag flying
there, and the sight always made him feel very
well disposed to run away again, but he never
did.</p>
<p>Dicky, however, discovered very unexpectedly
that he possessed a means of livelihood in
his beautiful young voice, and in the songs
that Jack Bell had taught him. But the
treasure of Dicky&rsquo;s life was a little dog&rsquo;s-eared,
ill-printed book of patriotic songs, all predicting
the speedy overthrow of John Bull, and the
certainty that the patriots would soon drive
every British soldier and sailor off American soil.
The book had been smuggled over from the
Narragansett side, and was rather a dangerous
possession. But as Dicky soon learned the
songs all by heart, it would not have mattered
if it had been found and destroyed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>It was the dream of Dicky&rsquo;s life though, as
well as of Jack Bell&rsquo;s, to compose a song themselves.
They had no scruples about adapting
somebody else&rsquo;s music, but they burned with
ambition to create a new set of words which
rhymed. Many a night before it was time
for Jack&rsquo;s watch to begin, would he and Dicky
struggle over a slate on which they had marked
lines, something like this:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">____sea</p>
<p class="t0">____be</p>
<p class="t0">____shore</p>
<p class="t0">____gore</p>
<p class="t0">____sail</p>
<p class="t0">____hail</p>
</div>
<p>But they never got any farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me, young &rsquo;un,&rdquo; said Jack, scratching
his head, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re beginnin&rsquo; at the wrong
end. It&rsquo;s stern foremost, d&rsquo;ye see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Dicky would reply, &ldquo;but in poetry
I believe you are obliged to begin stern foremost&mdash;because
if you begin at the beginning
you never get any poetry&mdash;just as if it was
makin&rsquo; a song like this:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &rsquo;Mericans are gallant lads; they&rsquo;re
bound to whip Johnny Bull. It don&rsquo;t make no
matter if Johnny Bull has got more ships and
soldiers. We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to whip him. Now
that ain&rsquo;t poetry, because I begun at the
beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Jack would reluctantly admit;
&ldquo;but if it ain&rsquo;t poetry, it&rsquo;s mighty good sense,
and I hope it&rsquo;ll all come true.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>In those days tavern kitchens were very
respectable resorts of the humbler classes of
people and Jack Bell was very fond of the
kitchen of the Eagle Tavern. The proprietor,
Jacob Dyer, was a patriot at heart; but his
house was so much the resort of British sailors
and soldiers that he dared not avow the full
extent of his sympathies.</p>
<p>In the kitchen Dicky made most of his pennies&mdash;and
he made so many that they soon
grew into shillings. It might have been rather
a dangerous place to trust a weak or a vicious
boy; but Dicky was neither weak nor vicious.
He went to the tavern to sing his songs, and
when he got through he scampered off home to
his mother with his money and was very glad
to get there. Besides, at the time when he usually
turned up at the tavern to sing, Jack Bell
was comfortably established in the chimney-corner
and he kept a sharp eye on Dicky and
promptly reported any bad manners or other
small offences to the Widow Stubbs, who upon
the few occasions that Dicky had transgressed
always came down on him with the heavy hand
of justice armed with a good birch switch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>One afternoon Dicky turned up at the tavern,
as usual, and found the kitchen full of sailors
from several cruisers of Lord Howe&rsquo;s fleet that
had rendezvoused at Newport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, you young rapscallion!&rdquo;
called out one jolly man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s-man. &ldquo;Come
here and give us &lsquo;Black-eyed Susan&rsquo; or I&rsquo;ll
give you the cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This being the usual form in which those
requests were made, Dicky nodded his head,
grinned, and perched himself on the kitchen
dresser to be heard the better. Having trolled
out &ldquo;Black-eyed Susan,&rdquo; &ldquo;Strike Eight Bells,&rdquo;
and other nautical ditties in his sweet boyish
treble, Dicky got down and began to hand his
homespun hat around for pennies. The sailors
were liberal and Dicky was beginning to think
how his mother would smile as he upset the
hat in her lap, when one of the sailors, a fellow
with a great voice, seized him and, holding up
a glass of rum, called out: &ldquo;Here, you lubber!
come and drink the king&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged, sir,&rdquo; answered Dicky readily;
&ldquo;but my mother don&rsquo;t on no account let me
touch rum, and I&rsquo;ve promised her I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>How glad was Dicky at that moment that he
had made the promise! His mother had asked
him and he had done it without giving it any
particular thought; but when it came to saving
him from drinking the king&rsquo;s health, Dicky&rsquo;s
patriotic soul rejoiced that he had so good an
excuse.</p>
<p>The man, rough as he was, could not ask the
boy to break his word, but he was determined
to get some British sentiment out of Dicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you pipe up &lsquo;God Save the King&rsquo; as
loud as you can,&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I c-c-can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dicky, looking around at
Jack Bell in the corner. Jack gave him an
almost imperceptible wink and nod, which
meant: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right; stick to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you shall!&rdquo; roared the sailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; shouted Dicky boldly, and
making a dash for the rolling-pin on the
dresser, which he seized and flourished stoutly.</p>
<p>The sailor made a dash for Dicky, who, as
alert as a monkey, pushed a chair in front of
him, over which the sailor fell sprawling. The
next minute Dicky gave the window a terrific
whack that smashed sash and all, and, scrambling
through, took to his heels and was
almost home by the time the sailor had got
through rubbing his bruised shins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>The Widow Stubbs was scrupulously honest,
and her first comment after she had praised
Dicky for keeping his word about the rum
and refusing to sing &ldquo;God Save the King&rdquo;
was:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, son, we must pay for the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mammy,&rdquo; said Dicky ruefully; &ldquo;and I
lost three shillings and my hat too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night when Jack Bell came in for his
usual chat on the settle, he told Dicky:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, boy, and if it&rsquo;s too hard a pull
for you and your mammy to pay for the winder,
why, Jack Bell has got some of the rhino and
you&rsquo;re welcome to it, for I see how you stuck
up to your promise and to your country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that minute a knock came at the door,
and when Dicky opened it Jacob Dyer walked
in. Both the widow and Dicky thought he had
come for his money for the window, and the
Widow Stubbs began: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have any
fear, sir, that I won&rsquo;t pay for what my boy did
to-day, and pay it cheerful, to know I&rsquo;ve got a
boy who can keep his word to me, and can&rsquo;t
be frightened into singing &lsquo;God Save the
King.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Widder,&rdquo; said Jacob, &ldquo;your boy is welcome
to smash that winder. Maybe he&rsquo;s got more
courage than Jacob Dyer; for although I can&rsquo;t
sing &lsquo;God Save the King,&rsquo; chiefly because I
don&rsquo;t know how to sing anything, I feel
sometimes as if I ought to be more outspoken
than I am for my country. But I have a wife
and eight children to support, and if I got the
redcoats down on me, they&rsquo;d close my tavern
and then I&rsquo;d be on the town. But sometimes
my blood biles when I hear &rsquo;em talk about
lickin&rsquo; General Washington. I kem to-night
to tell you that if I look cross at your boy the
next time he comes to the tavern he needn&rsquo;t
mind. You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t pay a cent for the winder,
and I&rsquo;d be a good deal more of a &rsquo;Merican if
my livin&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t depend on the redcoats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very next day Dicky showed up in the
tavern kitchen. As usual, redcoats were plenty.
Jacob Dyer, in a huge white apron, was
superintending the turning of the spit. As
soon as he caught sight of Dicky he began
to grumble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes that Stubbs boy as cost me
five shilling for a glazier&rsquo;s bill. If it warn&rsquo;t that
his mother&rsquo;s a widder, I&rsquo;d be after him, I can
tell you. But look out, you young scamp, if
ever you get to wreckin&rsquo; my premises again,
I&rsquo;ll get after you as sure as shootin&rsquo;. Do you
mind that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Dicky very meekly and
not in the least alarmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AN IMPORTANT ERRAND.</span></h2>
<p>Visitors were few at the widow&rsquo;s cottage,
but the very night after Jacob Dyer had
been there another knock at the door ushered
in a very different visitor. The widow had just
trimmed the fire, swept the hearth, and drawn
up the settle, and was waiting for Jack and
Dicky to come in and get their supper of milk
and porridge and potatoes, when a thundering
rat-tat-tat came at the door. When she opened
it, there stood an elderly gentleman in a cocked
hat and handsome knee buckles and a gold-headed
cane. The widow knew him in a
moment. He was Squire Stavers, one of the
richest citizens of Newport and a staunch patriot.
The widow was rather flustered by the importance
of her caller, but invited him in politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, madam,&rdquo; began Squire Stavers,
&ldquo;that you have an uncommonly reliable
boy&mdash;a little fellow who goes about singing
for his living.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the widow, all in a
flutter. &ldquo;It mayn&rsquo;t seem such a steady business
for a boy, but the times are so hard I can&rsquo;t
find anything else for him to do, and he makes
a very good living and brings all his money
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His employment will answer very well for
the present,&rdquo; replied the squire, &ldquo;and when
times become more settled no doubt you can
find honorable work for him. What I came to
see you about to-night was in connection with
him. Is there any danger of being overheard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer the widow rose and bolted the
door of the cottage and&mdash;rare luxury!&mdash;lighted
two tallow candles. Then the squire continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, madam, that you are the widow of
a Continental soldier and may be depended
upon to help your country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the widow quite
promptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;This, then, is what I wish to say. The
patriots of Newport desire to communicate with
the Continental forces at Providence Plantations,
and if they can get a trusty messenger as
far as Tiverton, there will be no difficulty the
rest of the way. We dare not employ a man
on this service as we are closely watched. But
a boy would never be suspected, and our communication
would be in the form of a letter that
would reveal nothing in case it was found.
Mr. James Barton, who has a gallant son in
the Continental Army, and myself are old
friends, and we are supposed to be corresponding
for pleasure and profit. Mr. Barton, for
example, has beeves to sell, and writes me asking
the price in the market. His younger son
has lately visited my house, and in my letter I
speak of him. Yet there is a hidden meaning
in all this, and it would be of substantial help
to the cause if we could carry information in
that manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will wait a few moments, sir, I will
ask Mr. Bell&rsquo;s opinion. He&rsquo;s a steady, sensible
man, and although I&rsquo;m perfectly willing to
let my boy do all he can, I&rsquo;d rather consult
Mr. Bell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>At that moment they both heard Dicky and
Jack Bell fumbling at the latch. The widow
rose and let them in, then bolted the door again.</p>
<p>Jack Bell knew well enough who Squire
Stavers was, and when Dicky heard that he,
Dicky Stubbs, was actually wanted for an
important service, he could scarcely forbear
hurrahing and cutting the pigeon wing in his
delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let me read you the letter I wish the
lad to carry,&rdquo; said the Squire, putting on his
great gold spectacles, and taking a letter from
his pocket. &ldquo;Suppose your boy is stopped.
Let him at once produce this letter, and if the
British can find out anything from it, they are
cleverer than I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<blockquote>
<p><i>My dear Sir</i>,&mdash;</p>
<p>Your letter, enquiring what price beeves
will fetch, is received, and I made a note of
the contents. No one can understand
who has not been here lately, the extremely low
price that animal produce has fallen to.
But let me know in regard to the beeves,
stating whether you wish to sell them on the hoof
or not, which is important. The lad who takes this
can bring a verbal message straight enough,
but it would be safest to write, as boys are
but heedless creatures, and of their own memory,
they are overconfident. However, the bearer of this,
may be your son, as I am expecting him to return
this way, and I may keep it for him. The town is
closely patrolled, and although the force here is large,
it is remarkably well disciplined. Your son was very
popular among the young ladies, who seemed determined
to surround and capture him. The place is not
what it was in times of peace, as it is very dull,
the military being obliged to see an extremely strict
watch kept, and it would not be difficult
in consideration of the unsettled state of affairs
to believe that we are in a state of siege, which is
a serious matter. There is but an indifferent
interest taken in welfare of the town, except by
General Prescott commanding the land forces.
He is an able officer, and his loss would be
very great should he be transferred. I am thinking
of taking up my residence at the Eagle Tavern, or
at the Overing House, on the outskirts of the town.</p>
<p>I should let my house to a staff officer of my
acquaintance who wants it for six months.
General Prescott has taken up his quarters
as if he meant to stay, and it leads me to think that
no change of commanders is impending.</p>
<p>I am,
<span class="center">Your Friend and Obedient Servant,</span>
<span class="jr">WENTWORTH STAVERS.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jack Bell listened with great solemnity to the
reading of this letter, and when the Squire finished
reading and lay back in the chair with a triumphant
smile, Jack remarked with emphasis:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to hurt a babby in that
&rsquo;ere letter. It&rsquo;s all plain sailin&rsquo;, as fur as I can
see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>The Widow Stubbs agreed with him, and
Dicky thought privately it was one of the
stupidest letters he had ever read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; cried the Squire with a victorious
air, &ldquo;suppose you read every third line,
beginning at the third from the bottom. Here
you are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Prescott has taken up his quarters
at the Overing House on the outskirts of the
town. He is an able officer and his loss would
be a serious matter. There is but an indifferent
watch kept, and it would not be difficult to
surround and capture him. The place is not
closely patrolled, and, although the force here
is large, they are overconfident. The bearer
of this can bring a verbal message straight
enough. But let me know in regard to the
beeves; the contents no one can understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what do you say to that?&rdquo; inquired
the Squire as he finished the interpretation of
the letter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>Jack Bell&rsquo;s jaw dropped and Dicky almost
rolled on the floor in his surprise, while his
mother took the letter and, counting the lines,
saw how the information conveyed in it was so
different from what appeared on the surface.
Presently Jack Bell recovered himself enough
to bring his hand down on the table with a
thwack that made the candles jump and everybody
in the room jump, too.</p>
<p>The Squire enjoyed the sensation he had
given his simple audience and looked around
with an air of much satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I want this letter taken to
Tiverton, ten miles up. If the boy takes it, I
will lend him a horse,&rdquo;&mdash;here Dicky could not
forbear thrusting his tongue into his cheek and
wagging his head with rapture,&mdash;&ldquo;and if he
is stopped on the way, let him hand out the
letter. They will probably read it and pass
him on. And one thing may be of use to you&mdash;I
will give you two shillings if you bring me
an answer back; so, if you are stopped, tell your
captors that and they will probably let you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Squire then rose to leave and, standing
with his hand on his gold-headed cane, spoke
impressively:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have confided in all of you to-night, and
if one word from any of you gives rise to suspicion,
there will be deep and serious trouble
for all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can answer for me and my boy,&rdquo; said the
widow, while Jack Bell made reply:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can answer, sir, for Jack Bell, as who is
a uneddicated man, but ain&rsquo;t a fool, nor yet a
rascal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, and good-by to all of you.
The boy must be at my house at sunrise to-morrow
morning. He ought to be back by the
early afternoon, and if he is not, I myself will
go and look for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Squire then went out and the widow and
Jack Bell and Dicky sat and looked at each
other, the widow unmindful of the extravagance
of burning two candles when there was
no distinguished company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she after a pause, &ldquo;the boy
can&rsquo;t come to harm just riding between here
and Tiverton&mdash;do you think so, Mr. Bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of the hearty assurance that the
widow expected, Jack looked quite solemn and
seemed to avoid an answer. But the widow&rsquo;s
pleading eyes forced a reply out of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t the distance, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;that&rsquo;s neither
here nor there&mdash;and the boy could leg it easy
enough. But horses is ornnateral sort o&rsquo;
beasts and they&rsquo;ve got a special spite ag&rsquo;in
sailor men and sailor boys too. I never see a
sailor man git on a horse that I didn&rsquo;t see the
four-legged scoundrel kinder look around with
a devilish grin, as much as to say: &lsquo;Aha, I&rsquo;ve
got you now! You ain&rsquo;t a-ridin&rsquo; the spanker
boom, nor yet the topsail yard, and I&rsquo;ll bounce
you off or bust&rsquo;&mdash;and they most in gin&rsquo;ally
don&rsquo;t bust. I can&rsquo;t help feelin&rsquo; oneasy about
trustin&rsquo; him a horseback, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow laughed at this and Dicky cried
out indignantly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Bell, I&rsquo;d just as lief ride anything
from an elephant to a goat. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t any
harder to stick on a horse than it is to hold
on to the topsail yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is, boy,&rdquo; answered Jack with much
severity, &ldquo;and a sight more dangersome.
Horses, I tell you, has a spite ag&rsquo;in sailor men&mdash;and
they&rsquo;re mighty cunnin&rsquo; in carryin&rsquo; out
their ill-will. I wish you was goin&rsquo; to leg it.
That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AN ADVENTURE WITH THE REDCOATS.</span></h2>
<p>Dicky was sent to bed early that night, so
he could have a good sleep before his
journey. But he was so excited over the prospect
of his coming adventures that he scarcely
closed his eyes. He was up and dressed by
daybreak, and his mother had hard work holding
him until sunrise before starting off.</p>
<p>As it was, he arrived at the Squire&rsquo;s fine
house in the town, before the Squire was up.
When the horse was led out for him to mount,
Dicky made a rush at him and scrambled up,
beaming with delight. It was quite a sober
old cart horse, named Blackberry&mdash;but had he
been the finest thoroughbred in the world he
could not have given Dicky more pleasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>The Squire gave him the letter before several
of the servants, without any extraordinary
charges of carefulness, merely telling him to
deliver it with his own hands to Mr. Josiah
Barton, of Tiverton, and to return as soon
as possible, when he would receive two shillings&mdash;and
not to ride Blackberry too hard.</p>
<p>Dicky listened very respectfully, put the
letter in the bosom of his jacket and pinned it,
and started off. He rode very slowly as long
as he was in sight of the Squire&rsquo;s house, but it
must be admitted that as soon as he turned the
first corner he gave old Blackberry a cut that
started him on a sharp trot. Blackberry, however,
like the Squire himself, was well fed, his
load was light, the day was pleasant, and he
was quite willing to play the colt for a while, so
he and Dicky got on beautifully.</p>
<p>The morning was deliciously fresh, and
Dicky, who had never been ten miles from
Newport in his life, except when he had run
away on the Betsey, was as happy as a bird
and felt himself quite as much of a man as Jack
Bell. He was so happy that when he had
gone two or three miles he could not forbear
breaking into song&mdash;and as galloping and
singing are somewhat incongruous he brought
Blackberry down to a leisurely walk. Then
with his knee crossed on the saddle he began
to sing some of his favorite songs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>Unluckily though, he chose one of his rebel
songs as they were called, and he was trolling it
out in his sweetest voice when presently looking
up, he found himself almost riding over a
squad of redcoats marching along the road with
a sergeant at their head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, you young rebel!&rdquo; called out the
sergeant, catching Blackberry&rsquo;s bridle; &ldquo;what
are you up to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing wrong,&rdquo; answered Dicky boldly
although he felt a slight tremor at heart&mdash;but
he knew the necessity of keeping a cool
exterior. &ldquo;I am on my way to Tiverton on an
errand for Squire Stavers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know this is the King&rsquo;s highway,
and you were singing a song about,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;At Bunker Hill, that glorious day,</p>
<p class="t0">The time the redcoats ran away.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Dicky remained prudently silent and wished
he had not sung his Bunker Hill song.</p>
<p>The sergeant, who was a powerful fellow with
a good-natured face in spite of his bluff words,
reached up, and lifting Dicky off the horse as
if he were a baby, set him down on the ground
and proceeded to search him. The first thing
he ran across was the letter. &ldquo;Come now,&rdquo;
said the sergeant, &ldquo;the lieutenant must see this.
From Squire Stavers to Josiah Barton of
Tiverton. Both of them out-and-out rebels.
Young man, will you please to &rsquo;bout face and
march along, while I&rsquo;ll ride your battle horse?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p5.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="686" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;LOOK OUT, YOU YOUNG REBEL,&rsquo; CALLED OUT THE SERGEANT.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>This was an unkind slur on Blackberry, who
was unmistakably a horse who had spent his
life in civil pursuits. The sergeant mounted
him, and the old horse, out of whom Dicky had
taken most of the spirit, struck into a slow and
dejected trot.</p>
<p>Dicky went along silently, and appeared to
be neither frightened or discomposed. Indeed
after a while he rather relished his adventure,
and anticipated the telling of it with the keenest
pleasure, in which he meant to do full
justice to his own calmness under trying circumstances.
The whole party walked down
the road about half a mile, when they came to
a deserted farmhouse. The sergeant, then dismounting,
took Dicky by the shoulder and
shoved him into a room where a young officer
sat at a table writing. &ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo;
said the sergeant, touching his cap, &ldquo;I found
this boy riding along the road, singing rebel
songs. I thought I&rsquo;d examine him to see if
there was anything suspicious about him, and I
found this letter directed to Josiah Barton of
Tiverton,&mdash;a rank rebel,&mdash;and the boy says it
is from Squire Stavers of Newport, who is
another rank rebel. So I thought it would be
safer to bring him and the letter to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said the young officer, and
taking the letter he coolly broke the seal. Both
he and the sergeant were keeping half an eye
on Dicky, who was perfectly quiet and composed,
and gave no indications of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what is in this letter?&rdquo;
asked the lieutenant of Dicky after glancing
at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; answered Dicky, suddenly recalled
from a contemplation of old Blackberry through
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what is in this letter?&rdquo;
repeated the lieutenant sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something about beef cattle, I believe,
sir,&rdquo; answered Dicky, returning to the contemplation
of his steed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>It was an ordinary letter enough, but still
the lieutenant did not seem able to persuade
himself that it was exactly what it appeared to
be. He could scarcely imagine, though, that
a compromising letter would be sent by a boy,
and, moreover, a boy who loitered by the road-side
singing songs. It occurred to him that
he could find out something of the value of
the letter by the price that was paid Dicky for
taking it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, my lad,&rdquo; he said suddenly;
&ldquo;how much are you to get if you deliver this
letter and bring a reply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two shillings, sir,&rdquo; promptly replied Dicky;
&ldquo;but if I don&rsquo;t deliver it, I ain&rsquo;t to get anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; said the young officer more
to himself than to Dicky. &ldquo;A two-shilling messenger
is not likely to be charged with serious
undertakings. You may go, youngster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the next minute Dicky had darted out
of the door and, seizing old Blackberry, was
off at a smarter trot than Blackberry had
known for a good many years.</p>
<p>Dicky arrived at Tiverton about nine o&rsquo;clock
and easily found the solid, substantial Barton
mansion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>Mr. Barton was standing on the broad brick
porch when Dicky swung himself off Blackberry
and, holding his shabby cap in his hand,
presented the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The seal, sir, was broken by a redcoat
officer a little way out from Newport; but he
didn&rsquo;t understand the letter,&rdquo; Dicky added
significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is easily understood,&rdquo; said Mr. Barton,
looking up after he got to the end.</p>
<p>Boylike, Dicky was charmed at being able
to show the extent of his knowledge and responsibilities.
Coming up close to Mr. Barton,
he pointed out the third line from the bottom.
Mr. Barton&rsquo;s eyes followed Dicky&rsquo;s finger as it
traveled upward over the page, and he grasped
the meaning immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said he after a pause, &ldquo;there are
some things I want to ask you. Come in the
house with me and do exactly what I tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky followed him in a small, dark room
on the first floor, fitted up as a library. Mr.
Barton directed him to take a chair and then
disappeared behind him for a few moments.
When he came back he said:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now answer freely and to the best of your
ability all the questions I shall ask you, but
remember not to turn your head to look on
either side or behind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky thought this strange, but he obeyed
implicitly. Mr. Barton, then taking out a quill
pen and paper, began to ask him a series of
questions respecting the Overing House&mdash;its
distance from the shore, the lay of the land,
and many other things of information. Dicky,
not being one of those boys who can spend a
lifetime in a place without knowing anything
about it, was able to give a pretty accurate
description of things in and around Newport.
Especially did he know where the British ships
were moored, the hours for the boats, and many
other particulars about them.</p>
<p>While looking in front of him, as Mr. Barton
carefully wrote down what he said, Dicky observed
a round mirror, and what he saw in it
almost made him drop off his chair in surprise.
For there was a door behind him slightly ajar,
and every now and then he caught a glimpse
of a young man wearing a Continental uniform
and listening intently to what was said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>Dicky felt an intense curiosity to know who
it was, and, while describing as well as he could
a tortuous path that he knew leading from the
shore to a clump of woods behind the Overing
House, he happened to glance up at the mirror.
The soldier behind him had become so interested
that he had poked his head completely
outside the door.</p>
<p>One glance in the mirror showed Dicky that
the young man was the son of Mr. Barton, and
he surmised shrewdly that it was the young
Captain Barton of the Continental Army who
was his unseen listener. He was plainly in
hiding, and Dicky understood very well why
the elder Barton imposed cautions upon
him.</p>
<p>Mr. Barton was very well pleased with Dicky&rsquo;s
sensible and well-considered answers, and when
he had got through he folded up the memorandum
he had made, wrote a few lines to Squire
Stavers about the beeves, and then handed
Dicky two new shillings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money is a scarce commodity about here,&rdquo;
he said, smiling, &ldquo;but I think you have earned
this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Mr. Barton then asked him to stay until
dinner was ready, but this Dicky declined to
do. He was very proud of the success of his
errand so far and wanted to return promptly,
so that in a little while he was on his way back
to Newport.</p>
<p>Squire Stavers was not without his doubts
concerning the time Dicky would return. A
boy trusted with a horse is extremely liable to
overstay his time; but before twelve o&rsquo;clock
Dicky turned up. The Squire looked sharply
at Blackberry, but, although the old horse had
had a pretty good morning&rsquo;s work, he seemed
to realize that he was bent upon a patriotic
errand and was as lively as a colt.</p>
<p>Dicky did not fail to do ample justice to his
own coolness and composure when nabbed by
the redcoats, and his prompt surrendering of
the letter. The Squire chuckled when Dicky
described how the young lieutenant puzzled
over it and handed Dicky out two shillings
with great readiness, saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as you are such a good hand in the
transaction of business, I will employ you
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky ran home as fast as his legs could
carry him with his four shillings clutched in his
hands, and, throwing three of them in his
mother&rsquo;s lap, held up the fourth, bawling,&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give Mr. Bell and me a treat
with this, mammy, because I&rsquo;m a very bright
boy, I am,&mdash;the Squire said so,&mdash;and a reliable
one, too. There&rsquo;s a show in town of
dancing bears and monkeys, and Mr. Bell and
me are going sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jack came in that night Dicky recounted
all of his adventures, even to the
seeing the officer behind him in the glass,
which he had not mentioned to Squire Stavers.
The widow was immensely proud of Dicky&rsquo;s
shrewdness and courage, and Jack Bell was
perfectly delighted, especially that Dicky had
proved a match for old Blackberry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; a sight better sarvice for your
country than if you was a powder boy &rsquo;board
ship,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a deal more
riskier to handle a horse than it is to handle
gunpowder, and I&rsquo;m a-thinkin&rsquo; sumpin&rsquo; will
happen soon;&rdquo; with which sententious remark
Bell retired to the loft to sleep, while Dicky
tumbled into his flock bed&mdash;a very tired but a
very happy boy&mdash;and dreamed all night about
dancing bears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JACK BELL&rsquo;S SECRET.</span></h2>
<p>Three more trips did Dicky make to Tiverton,
and each time, under the cover of
a transaction in beef cattle, carried important
news. He was rather puzzled, though, to
know what the news was, as Squire Stavers
did not tell him the contents of any letters but
the first. Neither the Squire nor Mr. Barton
ever mentioned General Prescott&rsquo;s name before
him. Dicky rashly concluded that the scheme
to capture the British general had been abandoned.</p>
<p>He had never seen General Prescott to know
him in his life. There were crowds of British
officers dashing about the town with orderlies
trotting after them; but which was the general
he did not know. In fact, after a while Dicky
begun to suspect that his trips were for the
sole purpose of conveying news about the
cattle after all, and felt a distinct decrease in
his own importance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Jack Bell, too, seeing that everything appeared
quiet and that the British had lately
had successes, especially in having captured
Major-General Henry Lee,&mdash;&ldquo;Light Horse
Harry,&rdquo;&mdash;began to be very much depressed.
He and Dicky discussed affairs very often, and
both of them came to the melancholy conclusion
that Newport would remain in the hands
of the British until the end of the war and
that nothing would be attempted in the way of
a capture.</p>
<p>The Americans were anxious to make an
exchange for General Lee, but had no officer
of rank high enough to offer for him. This
was a mortifying fact, and Jack Bell, commenting
on it, wondered why the plan to kidnap
General Prescott had fallen through.</p>
<p>One night, though, Squire Stavers sent for
him, and Jack came away from the Squire&rsquo;s
house wearing a look of delighted expectancy.</p>
<p>About a week after that, one morning as
soon as he wakened&mdash;which was late, as he
was out all night&mdash;he called Dicky, and the
two strolled together toward a lonely point of
rocks some distance from any house and where
they were not likely to be disturbed by anyone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>The sun shone brightly, while a sharp wind
ruffled the waters of Narragansett Bay and
gave a kick to the sterns of several vessels
that were rounding Point Judith.</p>
<p>It fluttered the pennants of a great British
fleet that lay off Block Island and dashed the
steel blue water fiercely against the rocky
shores upon which the town of Newport is
perched. So blue was the sky and so blue was
the sea that they came together invisibly on
the far horizon, and a fine English frigate
which was sailing in under a huge spread of
canvas seemed to be suspended between the
sky and the sea.</p>
<p>Among the fleet there was the usual activity
and business of the morning. A great line-of-battle
ship, with the red pennant flying at her
fore, indicating that she was taking on powder,
lay out in the foreground. An admiral&rsquo;s
barge at the gangway of a handsome black
frigate showed that she had distinguished
company on board, and the sound of the band
playing on the quarterdeck and the noise made
by the parading of the marine guard was distinctly
borne ashore by the wind. On every
ship something was going on in the way of the
orderly bustle of a man-of-war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>On shore, too, the morning drill was taking
place, and the regiments of redcoats made a
brilliant splash of color in the sombre tones
of the ancient town. The scene was charming
in itself, but to Jack Bell and Dicky Stubbs
nothing was more disheartening than the
evidences of the might of England.</p>
<p>Presently the advancing frigate, which was
trotting along briskly, came near enough for
Jack Bell to recognize her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Diomede, sonny,&rdquo; said Jack
dolefully, as if the arrival of another British
ship filled his cup of woe to overflowing.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n Forrester on the bridge&mdash;a
mighty fine man he is, if he is a Britisher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky agreed with this as with everything
else that Jack Bell advanced.</p>
<p>As the frigate rounded to, in her usual grand
style, Jack&rsquo;s eyes kindled although he sighed.
&ldquo;It do a sailor man&rsquo;s heart good for to see
a ship anchored that way. I&rsquo;ve knowed the
Diomede ever since she slid off the stocks, and
she never was counted on bein&rsquo; no great sailer&mdash;but
the sailin&rsquo; qualities of a ship depends on
the cap&rsquo;n&mdash;d&rsquo; ye mind that, youngster; and
Cap&rsquo;n Forrester, he knows how to handle a
ship, d&rsquo; ye see, boy? But I&rsquo;m a-wishin&rsquo; she
warn&rsquo;t flying that &rsquo;ere flag at her peak. If
&rsquo;twas only the American flag now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder &rsquo;tis,&rdquo; said Dicky, pointing across to
Narragansett Bay, where he fancied he could
see it flying in the blue air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you can see it,&rdquo; answered Jack
reflectively as he gazed over the blue water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I wish I were fighting under it!&rdquo;
cried Dicky, whose patriotic ardor increased
rather than abated by living under British rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dessay,&rdquo; remarked Jack slyly, who was
much given to &ldquo;pulling a leg&rdquo; at Dicky&rsquo;s
expense, &ldquo;if our people over yonder knowed
about you, they&rsquo;d be most as distrested as they
are about Gineral Lee bein&rsquo; held by the
British&mdash;&rsquo;twould take a major-gineral to exchange
for Gineral Lee, but maybe they could
git you for a major or a colonel, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps. What
a pity they ain&rsquo;t never heard on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky at this turned very red, and giving a
vicious kick to a stone sent it skimming across
the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said Dicky presently in a low
voice, looking around to be sure they were
completely alone on the rocks, &ldquo;I did the best
I could. I took three letters to Tiverton
and back&mdash;and I knew what they was meant
for too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True for you, boy,&rdquo; said Jack, slapping him
on the back; &ldquo;and now tell me, what do you
think I fetched you down on these rocks for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Jack very softly, &ldquo;sumpin&rsquo; &rsquo;s
up to-night. I&rsquo;ve knowed it for more &rsquo;n a
week, and I tell you because we want your valuable
sarvices.&rdquo; Jack could not refrain from
giving Dicky this little dig. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve
pledged my word, as you are a safe boy and
ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to blow the gaff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there, Mr. Bell,&rdquo; answered
Dicky proudly. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t the sort to blow
the gaff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, listen to me and come close, so
I can speak easy. There&rsquo;s a plot on hand to-night
to bag Gineral Prescott. He&rsquo;s a long-headed
old feller, although he is mighty proud,
treatin&rsquo; quarterdeck folks like they was foremast
people. But he knows more &rsquo;n most of &rsquo;em
what to do, so that&rsquo;s w&rsquo;y the patriots is
hankerin&rsquo; arter him. At nine o&rsquo;clock to-night
a boat is goin&rsquo; to be pulled acrost the bay, and
Cap&rsquo;n Barton with twenty men&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to sneak
up to the Overing House, where the Gin&rsquo;ral
is stayin&rsquo;, while they&rsquo;re fixin&rsquo; reg&rsquo;lar headquarters
for him. They&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to take the
house by boardin&rsquo;&mdash;I dunno what the soldiers&rsquo;
word is for ketchin&rsquo; him with a rush&mdash;and
they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to put him in the boat and take
him back to Providence Plantations. Now the
redcoats is monstrous keerless about standin&rsquo;
watch round the Overing House&mdash;they&rsquo;ve got
a sentry or two that marches up and down and
then goes and stands in the corner o&rsquo; the house
by the chimney&mdash;but Cap&rsquo;n Barton wants some
one to give him the word about twelve o&rsquo;clock
to-night when the coast is clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m to give the word,&rdquo; cried Dicky,
jumping with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you act that a-way,&rdquo; answered Jack
severely. &ldquo;When sailor men has got work in
hand they don&rsquo;t go bawlin&rsquo; out and jumpin&rsquo;
like a lizard over it. They says &lsquo;Aye, Aye,
sir,&rsquo; and then they goes and does it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky, quite crestfallen, awaited Jack&rsquo;s next
words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give the word myself, for I ain&rsquo;t under
no promise to Cap&rsquo;n Forrester. He just told
me the redcoats would see that I didn&rsquo;t git
away&mdash;and they do watch me pretty sharp&mdash;so
most likely I&rsquo;d be the very one they&rsquo;d suspect.
So I says to Squire Stavers: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s that little
tow-headed Dicky Stubbs that I knows has got
a head on his shoulders and a pair of eyes as is
worth sumpin&rsquo;&mdash;and he kin hang round the
house and won&rsquo;t nobody think it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; but
stayin&rsquo; out ag&rsquo;in his mother&rsquo;s orders&rsquo;&mdash;and
you&rsquo;re that chap,&rdquo; said Jack Bell, giving Dicky
a friendly thwack that nearly sent him head
foremost into the sea.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s face was a picture&mdash;it was fairly
beaming with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night!&rdquo; he whispered excitedly; &ldquo;twelve
o&rsquo;clock; to keep a bright lookout round the
Overing House!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;Purcisely,&rdquo; answered Jack Bell; &ldquo;the boat
will be down at the cove, and when you see
a man comin&rsquo; along the ravine through the
woods from the cove, with one hand raised up
this way&mdash;you&rsquo;ll slip up and let him know if
the coast is clear; and if the gineral is in bed&mdash;as
they wants him to be&mdash;you kin tell by
the blowin&rsquo; out of his candle in the room in the
nor&rsquo;west corner where he sleeps. So now, go
along with you, and don&rsquo;t come a-nigh me
to-day, &rsquo;cause folks might be wonderin&rsquo; what we
was a-talkin&rsquo; about. And I&rsquo;ll tell your mother
some time to-day, as you will be out p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps all
night&mdash;but you won&rsquo;t be doin&rsquo; any harm.
And if they catch you, mind you, set up a
mighty howl, like a great baby, and tell &rsquo;em
you&rsquo;re afraid your mother&rsquo;ll give you the cat&mdash;so
they&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re too young to know
anythin&rsquo;&mdash;and now be off with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky, with a beaming face, ran off. The
first thing that occurred to him was: &ldquo;If they
do nab the British general, what a fine song it
will make!&rdquo; for he had by no means given up
his ambition to write a song, and a rebel song
at that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">GENERAL PRESCOTT&rsquo;S CAPTURE.</span></h2>
<p>Dicky sang very industriously that day,
and was lucky, having nearly four shillings
to take home to his mother. Jack Bell
did not come to the kitchen that evening as
usual, but he had been there during the day.
After Dicky got his supper he lay down on
the settle before the fire and said knowingly
to his mother:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am, wake me up at ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stubbs quietly to this
uncommon request. She knew well enough
what was meant.</p>
<p>Dicky fully intended taking merely a cat
nap, but when ten o&rsquo;clock came his mother
had to shake him and pound him and drag
him nearly all over the floor to wake him
up. However, once waked up he knew in
an instant what was required of him, and he
put on his shabby greatcoat and hat quickly
enough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret
about me&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be home by daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, my boy,&rdquo; said the Widow
Stubbs in her calm way. &ldquo;Be sure you act like
a boy of sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; answered Dicky sturdily as he made
for the door.</p>
<p>The night was murky, and as Dick glanced
out upon the dark bosom of the bay he could
only tell the position of the British ships by the
lights twinkling dimly at their mastheads, while
the huge bulk of their black hulls made only a
deeper shadow in the half-darkness. Dicky
trudged along the straggling streets of the town
and presently he found himself in a country
lane that led toward the Overing House, a comfortable
old tavern convenient to the cantonments
of the troops, and where General Prescott
had established himself temporarily.</p>
<p>The house was not fully alight, as people
went to bed earlier in those days and ten
o&rsquo;clock was considered quite late. The kitchen
where the host and his humble friends gathered
was perfectly dark, but in the northwest corner
of the house a light still burned. This was in
General Prescott&rsquo;s room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Dicky crept close to the fence that surrounded
the house. Everything was perfectly
quiet&mdash;even the housedog slept peacefully on
the kitchen steps. After looking about very
carefully, he saw a path leading into the underbrush
toward the ravine.</p>
<p>He slipped across the yard and into this path,
and after what seemed to him a long, long
wait, he saw advancing noiselessly through the
gloom a man with one hand held up, as Jack
Bell had described. Dicky went up and whispered:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is quiet. The dog is asleep on
the back steps, and General Prescott&rsquo;s room is
directly at the front door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a minute more twenty men had silently
appeared, as if out of the ground, and among
them was a burly negro known as Sam Ink,
from his jetty blackness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>They crept through the fence and noiselessly
surrounded three sides of the house, the dog
meanwhile sleeping peacefully, as they were
careful not to go near enough to rouse him.
Almost as soon as their preparations were completed
the light in the northwest room was put
out. Dicky wondered what means they would
take to open the front door, which according to
the custom of the time was no doubt barred as
well as locked. He was quickly enlightened,
though, for as soon as the preparations were
complete Sam Ink backed off about twenty
yards, and then, starting on a run, he lowered
his head and made straight for the door, and
the next minute the crash of splintered wood
was heard and Sam&rsquo;s head had gone through the
panel of the door.</p>
<p>It was only the work of a second then to
undo the lock and take down the bar, and as
the sound of shuffling feet in various parts of
the house was heard General Prescott himself
opened the door of his room to see what was
the matter. He had no time to strike a flint,
but one of the Americans, who had a dark
lantern, suddenly flashed it on the group and
then twenty stalwart arms seized the British
officer and dragged him out of the door and
made a rush for the path through the
woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>Dicky had watched it all, having crept up on
the porch, and seeing in the one flash of the
lantern that General Prescott had on only
his nightclothes, Dicky darted in the room,
grabbed a pile of clothes that lay upon a chair,
and flew after the party in the boat.</p>
<p>They had already made much headway, and
as it was some minutes before the people in the
house had been able to get a light from the
slow process of the tinder box or raking over
the kitchen fire, the Americans had a good
start. They changed their direction soon after
entering the ravine, and half an hour&rsquo;s rapid
walking, and carrying the British officer,
brought them to their boats.</p>
<p>Dicky had expected to hear a loud protest
from General Prescott, but when he had
followed the party to their boats he saw the
reason of the general&rsquo;s silence. A long horse
pistol had been held to his head every step of
the way. General Prescott broke silence for the
first time as he was being hustled into the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no breeches on,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they be,&rdquo; cried Dicky in an excited
but subdued voice, and he threw a bundle of
clothes into the boat.</p>
<p>Desperate as their circumstances still were,
the Americans could not help laughing at this;
the more so when Sam Ink, his head uninjured
by being used as a battering ram, said politely:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lem me be your vally, suh. I&rsquo;se used to
bein&rsquo; great men&rsquo;s vally, suh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my good man,&rdquo; coolly replied
General Prescott as Sam with more haste than
elegance hustled the general&rsquo;s clothes on.</p>
<p>The boats then put out for the other side of
the bay, and Dick quickly turned and ran
toward home. A general alarm had been
given by that time, but everybody supposed
that the kidnappers were somewhere in the
woods near by, or possibly in some deserted
quarter of the town. Soldiers were running
about, the drum was beating, skyrockets had
been sent up, and the alarm had been conveyed
to the guardship in the harbor, which sent a
boat ashore to find out the cause of the
commotion.</p>
<p>Dicky got on all right until just as he
reached his mother&rsquo;s door in the narrow street
where they lived, when he ran full tilt into the
arms of a sergeant with a searching party.
Remembering that he had to play the part of a
small and frightened boy, Dicky, who was not
frightened in the least, screwed his face up and
broke out into a frightful howl as the sergeant
caught him by the collar of his jacket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! O-o-o-ooh!&rdquo; yelled Dicky. &ldquo;Let
me go&mdash;let me go! Please, sir, let me go! I
know my mother will give me a whipping for
bein&rsquo; out so late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; cried the sergeant gruffly,
&ldquo;have you seen anything of the gang that has
carried off General Prescott?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened just then and the Widow
Stubbs appeared with a candle in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s
you, Dicky. Very well, very well. A pretty
time of night it is for you to be out. Just hand
him over to me, sir,&rdquo; said the artful Mrs.
Stubbs to the sergeant, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll promise you
he won&rsquo;t be going around the streets at this
disreputable hour of the night for a good
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky, at this, who could hardly keep from
roaring out laughing, opened his mouth and
wailed louder than ever, until the sergeant
nearly shook the breath out of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut that potato trap of yours,&rdquo; cried the
sergeant, &ldquo;and listen to me. Have you seen a
gang of men carrying an officer off into the
woods? for that is what has just happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bright idea struck Dicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;A tall, fine looking man, as I&rsquo;ve seen
going in and out of the Overing House?&rdquo;
he whimpered.</p>
<p>At this Mrs. Stubbs turned pale, thinking
Dicky meant to turn traitor; but the sergeant
answered him eagerly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Dicky, stammering and
hesitating, &ldquo;I see a crowd o&rsquo; men carryin&rsquo;
somebody off, and they was on horseback&mdash;gallopin&rsquo;
along. The officer was tied to the
saddle&rdquo;&mdash;Dicky here remembered about the
pistol. &ldquo;They had a pistol to his head, and
they took the main road through Tiverton, sir.
The officer was on a white horse, sir. I seen
that, though it was so dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was impossible not to believe this circumstantial
account. The sergeant and his men
doublequicked it back to the barracks to send
mounted scouts out on the Tiverton road.
And meanwhile the Americans had rowed with
muffled oars across the bay and had landed
their prisoner on the opposite shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Dicky went into the house, and his mother
securely locked and barred the door and put
out the light; and when safe in darkness and
silence she caught Dicky in her arms and
cried:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brave lad! My sensible boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky never felt in all his life so proud and
happy before. And at that moment, they heard
Jack Bell, marching up and down the streets,
and roaring out, at the top of his lungs,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two bells, and Gineral Prescott is tooken!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DICKY&rsquo;S NEW SONG.</span></h2>
<p>The sensation in Newport for a day or
two was tremendous. It was not lessened
when a flag of truce from the American
commander announced that General Prescott
was in his hands, and he would be pleased to
exchange the British officer upon parole for an
American officer of equal rank, suggesting
Major-General Henry Lee, of the Light Horse
Brigade. In a short time the exchange was
effected, and General Prescott returned to
Newport as a paroled prisoner.</p>
<p>The British officers were deeply chagrined
at the boldness and success of the attack.
Much sympathy was felt for General Prescott.
He was a brave and capable officer, although
a stern martinet, and the ridiculous circumstances
of the affair leaked out and were much
laughed at on the sly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>No two souls were more delighted at the
outcome than old Jack Bell and Dicky Stubbs.
Dicky&rsquo;s ambition to have a song about it did
not seem likely to be gratified, so he and the
old sailor conceived the daring design of
composing the song themselves. This was
done in the long winter evenings sitting before
the kitchen fire and by the light of a single
tallow dip.</p>
<p>Jack Bell&rsquo;s accomplishments in the reading
and writing line consisted of the ability to spell
out the paragraphs of &ldquo;The Newport News
Letter&rdquo; and to write with much time and
trouble, in a large round hand, &ldquo;Jno. Bell.&rdquo;
Dicky, however, was quite expert with the
pen, although his poetic faculty was not nearly
so well developed. After a month&rsquo;s hard work,
and with infinite pains and labor, the song was
composed. An air was found for it, and Dicky
found himself possessed of the most popular
song in Newport.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>He dared not sing it where there was a
chance of redcoats being around, but at tavern
gatherings, with the doors and windows
securely fastened, &ldquo;The Capture of Prescott&rdquo;
was sure to be called for, and when trolled
forth the boy&rsquo;s sweet and thrilling treble always
brought down a roaring chorus of laughter
and cheers and more shillings than pennies.
It was not of a very high order of poetic merit.
Dicky was no embryo Milton or Shakespeare,
but it touched the pride of the Americans, and
that was enough.</p>
<p>Whenever this ditty was being sung Jack
Bell&rsquo;s face was a study. He leaned forward in
his chair, his hands on his knees, and his deep,
cavernous eyes glowing with delight, and at
intervals his great hobnailed boots would come
down on the floor with a loud thwack of
approval. Dicky, perched upon a table and
swinging his legs, as he cocked his chin in the
air, would trill it out with all the pleasure in his
life, and was naturally enormously proud of his
literary as well as his artistic success.</p>
<p>One night about three months after the
capture and exchange, and while General
Prescott was on board the Diomede frigate
waiting for a fair wind to set sail for England,
a farewell dinner was given on board to
the officers of the army and navy then at
Newport.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>Now, what poor Dicky Stubbs, the widow&rsquo;s
son, had to do with this dinner Dicky himself
would have been puzzled to tell, and he was
a much astonished and slightly frightened
boy when about dusk a corporal of marines
knocked at his mother&rsquo;s door and demanded
Dicky&rsquo;s presence. Jack Bell was sitting in the
kitchen, as he usually was at that hour, and
both he and the Widow Stubbs were certain
that the authorities had heard of the boy&rsquo;s
rebel songs and had come to arrest him.</p>
<p>As for Dicky, although a very courageous
boy in the main, he thought it prudent to retire
under the bed in the next room. The corporal,
though, having seen him rush in and disappear,
all except a pair of tell-tale heels, caught him
by the leg and dragged him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out o&rsquo; here!&rdquo; cried the corporal
gruffly but not unkindly.</p>
<p>Dicky, finding himself in the hands of the
enemy, recovered his self-possession and stood
up quite coolly and unconcernedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the little feller that goes about
and sings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my poor boy!&rdquo; cried the Widow
Stubbs, for once losing her courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-y-yes, sir, I am,&rdquo; stammered Dicky,
expecting the next moment to be put in double
irons and carried to headquarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the corporal, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re to come
aboard the Diomede frigate with me to sing
for the officers at a big jollification they&rsquo;re
havin&rsquo; to-night, and you wash your face and
comb your hair and put on your best jacket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sounded reassuring, and Dicky proceeded
to make his toilet with his mother&rsquo;s
help. The marine meanwhile entered into
conversation with Jack Bell in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; said the corporal, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
seen you at Gibralty on the old Colossus &rsquo;long
about &rsquo;70.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gibralty? Gibralty?&rdquo; meditatively replied
Jack Bell. &ldquo;Now where in the world is
Gibralty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the marine, laughing, &ldquo;we
knows all about you&mdash;and it was a deuced
lucky thing for you that you saved that officer&rsquo;s
life. Men has been shot for deserters afore
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re jokin&rsquo;!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack earnestly;
&ldquo;you marines is allust pullin&rsquo; a leg with
we poor sailor men, and we never knows when
you&rsquo;re jokin&rsquo; and when you ain&rsquo;t. Gibralty&mdash;ain&rsquo;t
that somewheres nigh to the Arches of
Pelago, close by Villy Franky?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it uncommon mixed up, but
I reckon you know more &rsquo;n you&rsquo;d let on,&rdquo;
answered the marine, still laughing. And
Dicky&rsquo;s toilet being completed by that time,
the marine rose to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worrit about this &rsquo;ere youngster,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said politely to the Widow Stubbs.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a-goin&rsquo; to sing to the officers after
dinner, and I&rsquo;ll fetch him home before ten
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; With which the marine walked out,
with Dicky trudging after him. They soon made
the boat and were pulled to the Diomede.</p>
<p>The marine took him to the fok&rsquo;sle, Dicky
staring with all his might at everything he saw.
In a few minutes an orderly appeared from the
ward room, and Dicky followed him aft.</p>
<p>When they reached the cabin door and Dicky
got his first peep inside, it literally took his
breath away. Such lights, such gorgeous
uniforms, such splendor his simple eyes had
never beheld.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>Around a long table glittering with glass and
plate and wax candles sat thirty or forty officers
all in uniform. Most of them wore the dark
blue and gold of the navy, but there were many
in blazing scarlet. Dicky recognized Captain
Forrester, and his eyes fell upon one directly
facing the door&mdash;a tall, handsome, stern-looking
man of middle age, in a brilliant uniform
of scarlet, a gold-hilted sword, and with his
breast covered with medals. The other officers
addressed him as &ldquo;General.&rdquo; All were in a jovial
humor and a rollicking chorus was dying away
as Dicky and the orderly appeared at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Captain Forrester at the head
of the table, &ldquo;this is our sweet-throated thrush
from the town of which we have heard so much.
This lad, gentlemen, is said to be the very
finest singer hereabouts, and we have sent for
him to add to our jollity this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky blushed at this compliment to his
powers and shuffled from one foot to another
in his embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Captain Forrester to him,
&ldquo;pipe up, sir; do your best, and give us a new
song. Something that we have never heard
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky reflected for a moment or two and
then, coloring and stammering, said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir&mdash;if you please, the only
new song I&rsquo;ve got is a patriot song, what you
calls a rebel song, sir&mdash;and&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, very well,&rdquo; cried the officers,
laughing. &ldquo;Give us a rebel song, then.
Come, my little man, pipe up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky still hesitated between fear and
bashfulness, when the &ldquo;General&rdquo; in scarlet
spoke up:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us that song, you young rebel, or I&rsquo;ll
see that you get the cat, sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus admonished, while much merriment
prevailed among the officers at the notion of
the rebel song being sung, Dicky cleared his
throat and in the midst of a dead silence began
to sing in his clear, sweet, boyish voice:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Twas on a dark and stormy night,</p>
<p class="t">The wind and waves did roar;</p>
<p class="t0">Bold Barton then, with twenty men,</p>
<p class="t">Went down upon the shore.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And in a whaleboat they set off</p>
<p class="t">To Rhode Island fair,</p>
<p class="t0">To catch a redcoat general,</p>
<p class="t">Who then resided there.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>As soon as Dicky began the song he had
noticed that it seemed to create great amusement,
and many sly looks were directed toward
the general. When Barton&rsquo;s name was mentioned
the fun became contagious, and at the
last line of the second stanza it became uncontrollable.
Shouts and roars of laughter resounded,
in which the general joined heartily,
and it was some minutes before Dicky could
proceed.</p>
<p>All this time he looked, as he was, perfectly
innocent, and could not for the life of him
imagine what the laughter was about. Dicky&rsquo;s
seriousness seemed to increase the hilarity,
which grew steadily as he kept on.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Through British fleets and guard boats strong</p>
<p class="t">They held their dangerous way,</p>
<p class="t0">Till they arrived unto their port,</p>
<p class="t">And then did not delay.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A tawny son of Afric&rsquo;s race</p>
<p class="t">Then through the ravine led,</p>
<p class="t0">And entering then the Overing House,</p>
<p class="t">Found the general in his bed.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But to get in they had no means,</p>
<p class="t">Except poor Cuffee&rsquo;s head,</p>
<p class="t0">Who beat the door down, then rushed in</p>
<p class="t">And seized him in his bed.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Stop, let me put my breeches on,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t">The general then did pray.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Your breeches, massa, I will take,</p>
<p class="t">For dress we cannot stay.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then through the stubble him they led,</p>
<p class="t">With shoes and breeches none,</p>
<p class="t0">And placed him in their boat quite snug,</p>
<p class="t">And from the shore were gone.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Soon the alarm was sounded loud,</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;The Yankees they have come</p>
<p class="t0">And stolen Prescott from his bed,</p>
<p class="t">And him they&rsquo;ve carried home.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At the mention of General Prescott&rsquo;s name
a perfect hullabaloo of laughter, stamping,
shouts, and cheers broke forth, none joining in
more heartily than the general, and it suddenly
dawned upon Dicky that it was General
Prescott himself who was present.</p>
<p>At the bare idea of this the boy grew ashy
pale and looked as if he would drop to the
floor, but this only increased the rapture of
their amusement. And in the midst of the
terrific noise General Prescott&rsquo;s voice was
heard shouting,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, you little rascal&mdash;tell the whole
story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p6.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="693" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;THE YANKEES, THEY HAVE COME AND STOLEN PRESCOTT FROM HIS BED.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Thus admonished, Dicky managed to continue
his song in a quavering voice, every
moment interrupted by shrieks of laughter
from his delighted audience.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The drums were beat, skyrockets flew,</p>
<p class="t">The soldiers shouldered arms,</p>
<p class="t0">And marched around the ground they knew,</p>
<p class="t">Filled with most dire alarms.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But through the fleet with muffled oar,</p>
<p class="t">They held their devious way,</p>
<p class="t0">Landed on Narragansett shore,</p>
<p class="t">Where Briton had no sway.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When unto the land they came,</p>
<p class="t">Where rescue there was none,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A right bold push,&rdquo; the general cried,</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Of prisoners I am one.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Never was there such a scene witnessed on
board a ship as at the conclusion of this song.
So wild was the noise of the stamping on the
floor and pounding on the table that the people
below thought the deck would come through.
Yells of laughter and enthusiastic cheering
mutually tried to drown out the other.
Officers threw themselves on the table, convulsed
with laughter, while tears streamed
down their cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Others leaned their shaking sides up against
the wall and yelled with laughter. In the
midst of it General Prescott, who had laughed
until he was almost in hysterics, threw Dicky a
bright gold guinea, crying, &ldquo;There, you young
dog, is a guinea for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky caught the guinea as it spun toward
him and, pulling his forelock as he ducked his
head, exclaimed: &ldquo;Thanky, sir!&rdquo; and then
turning made a bee-line for the fok&rsquo;sle.</p>
<p>A boat was just leaving&mdash;he scrambled into
it, and in a few minutes he was trotting up the
narrow street toward his home, a very happy
but somewhat frightened boy. He dashed into
the kitchen where the Widow Stubbs sat peacefully
knitting, while Jack Bell occupied his usual
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you, mammy!&rdquo; shouted Dicky,
throwing a gold guinea in his mother&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land sakes!&rdquo; cried the widow, &ldquo;where did
you get it from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From General Prescott,&rdquo; answered Dicky
with twinkling eyes; and then he told the story
of the song. The Widow Stubbs laughed until
she cried, and Jack Bell roared like a bull with
merriment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;y,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;that beats the
speckled Jews!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does indeed,&rdquo; answered Dicky as he
thrust his tongue knowingly into his cheek;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll say hooray for one British officer&mdash;hooray
for General Prescott!&mdash;and I&rsquo;m glad
I give him his breeches!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DICKY ENLISTS.</span></h2>
<p>A time came, though, when Newport was
evacuated by the British&mdash;and on that
glorious day there were no happier souls
than Dicky Stubbs and Jack Bell. Among the
great events was the sailing in to Newport of
the small squadron which made the beginning
of the American navy. To Jack Bell&rsquo;s patriotic
eyes they were the handsomest ships he had
ever seen in his life.</p>
<p>Jack and Dicky stood on the highest point of
the rocky shores of Newport and watched with
rapture the coming of the little squadron of
five vessels which, though small and lightly
armed, were yet to give a noble account of
themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boy!&rdquo; shouted Jack Bell as he gripped
Dicky by the collar, &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye see them ships?
They ain&rsquo;t big, and they ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; in &rsquo;em
heavier &rsquo;n a twelve pounder&mdash;but they&rsquo;ve got
hearts of oak&mdash;and let me tell you, boy, it&rsquo;s
the kind of heart you&rsquo;ve got, as mostly settles
whether you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to take a lickin&rsquo; or give
one, in a fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky showed his appreciation of this sentiment
by bawling out &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; as loud as he
could&mdash;but as he had been &ldquo;hooraying&rdquo; pretty
steadily for forty-eight hours past, his voice was
somewhat cracked. Dicky, however, was still
capable of making a good deal of patriotic noise.</p>
<p>The shores were black with shouting crowds,
and the American sailors and soldiers received
a greeting that made them sure of their welcome.
Dicky ran about all day long, sang all
his rebel songs to listening crowds, and refused
to accept a penny for his singing. At night
when he reached home, tired, hungry, sleepy,
and hoarse, but perfectly happy, he said to his
mother as he marched in: &ldquo;Mammy, I ain&rsquo;t got
any money for you&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t take it on a
day like this&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve sung the Bunker Hill
song and the General Prescott song and all
the patriotic songs I know&mdash;and I never had
such a good time in my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, my boy,&rdquo; said the Widow Stubbs,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t take any money for
singing on this glorious day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>The very next morning the inevitable occurred.
Dicky announced that he meant to
enlist as a seaman apprentice in the American
navy. His mother turned a little pale but said
no word. She was a brave woman and a sensible
one, too; and she saw that Dicky&rsquo;s taste
for a sea life was so strong that, if balked of it,
he would probably never be of much account in
any other calling. Jack Bell gave him one of
those friendly thwacks that almost knocked him
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, youngster,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The navy&rsquo;s
the place for a lad as wants to make his forting.
I don&rsquo;t mean a forting in money&mdash;there&rsquo;s fortings
and fortings; I means in carackter, and
bein&rsquo; stiddy and faithful, and in havin&rsquo; lashin&rsquo;s
o&rsquo; fun when your cruise is up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought,&rdquo; said the Widow Stubbs
timidly, &ldquo;there were some hard characters in
the navy, Mr. Bell?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty few&mdash;mighty few,&rdquo; answered Jack,
shaking his head gravely. &ldquo;When a landsman
and a sailor man gits to fightin&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s allus the
landsman&rsquo;s fault. And if it warn&rsquo;t for them
meddlesome marines, the sailor men never
would git into no trouble. But all the wuthless
rapscallions in creation is arter sailor men&mdash;and
if they warn&rsquo;t jest as stiddy and k&rsquo;rect as
they can be, &rsquo;taint no tellin&rsquo; the mischief they&rsquo;d
git into. There ain&rsquo;t no peaceabler folks in the
world nor sailor men, if they is jest let alone
and ain&rsquo;t balked of their will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Widow Stubbs thought this was true of
some other people besides sailor men.</p>
<p>Among the small American squadron, the
Raleigh, a smart little frigate armed with twelve
pounders, was easily the best; and Jack Bell,
having examined her all over, determined that
Dicky should enlist on her. No bright, capable
boy was likely to be refused, and Captain
Thompson, her commander, would have been
glad to get Jack Bell, too, of whom he had
heard something. The day that Jack took
Dicky aboard, to enlist him, Captain Thompson
asked to have the old sailor sent down in the
cabin. Jack went down and found a very
dashing young continental officer, proud of
his ship and anxious to do something for his
country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my man,&rdquo; said he to Jack; &ldquo;I have
had the lad you brought aboard put on the
ship&rsquo;s books, and I would like very much to
have you, too. I know all about you, and such
a man is valuable among the foremast people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d like mightily to come, sir,&rdquo; answered
Jack respectfully, &ldquo;but I was give my choice, by
Cap&rsquo;n Forrester of the Diomede frigate, of
promisin&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t enlist or of bein&rsquo; h&rsquo;isted up
at the yardarm. You see, sir,&rdquo; continued Jack,
coming a little nearer and putting on a knowing
look which Captain Thompson understood
perfectly well. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Forrester had got it
into his head that I were one Jack Bell who
sarved forty year in the British navy. But
when the war broke out, that there Jack Bell
thought as how he&rsquo;d be a villian to fight ag&rsquo;in
his own country, so he up and deserted. Now,
sir, supposin&rsquo; Cap&rsquo;n Forrester had said I were
that man? Why, sir, &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; taken a
court martial two hours to string me up at the
yardarm. So Cap&rsquo;n Forrester said as how he
wouldn&rsquo;t mention his suspicions to nobody, if
I&rsquo;d promise him I wouldn&rsquo;t enlist in the American
army, navy, or marine corps&mdash;and as you
see, sir, not bein&rsquo; a officer, the only thing for me
to do was to promise&mdash;so that&rsquo;s how it lays.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; answered Captain Thompson.
&ldquo;Nothing else could be expected of you;
but I am sorry. You can assist me though by
bringing me recruits,&mdash;men that you know are
steady and reliable,&mdash;and in that way you may
be of almost as much use to me as if you were
on the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee, sir; I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; responded Jack
with alacrity. Meanwhile Dicky had been inducted
into the fok&rsquo;sle as drummer boy and
helper to the Jack o&rsquo; the dust. He found plenty
of work to do, and a boatswain&rsquo;s mate after him
to see it well done; and the fare was hard and
the pay small. But Dicky was like everybody
who has found his real place in life, perfectly
satisfied. Every day Jack Bell came on board
to see him, and every day Dicky saw that the
old sailor became more and more despondent
because he, too, could not serve his country.
One day after Jack had very dolefully left the
ship, Jenkins, the boatswain&rsquo;s mate on board,
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this was England now, we could send out
a press gang and get that man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>Now, Dicky knew very well what a press gang
was&mdash;a body of sailors who went ashore at
night with an officer and authority to seize and
press men into the naval service. This set
Dicky to thinking, and he began to wonder if
Jack would not be very well pleased if he were
seized and forcibly taken on board the Raleigh
and made to work and fight. The very next
night Dicky got his first liberty on shore, and
going to his mother&rsquo;s cottage found Jack there,
as usual, smoking his pipe.</p>
<p>The Widow Stubbs was delighted to see her
boy, and he looked so clean and smart and
bright in his sailor&rsquo;s rig that she could not but
see that he had improved in the little while that
he had been aboard ship. Jack showed his
usual interest in everything that happened on
the Raleigh, but Dicky saw that the old sailor
was much depressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bell,&rdquo; said Dicky after a while, &ldquo;Mr.
Jenkins, the boatswain&rsquo;s mate, says, as if there
was a press gang &rsquo;lowed in the American navy,
we could get some mighty good men; we&rsquo;d like
to have&mdash;you, sir, for one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack shook his head forlornly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no press gang, more&rsquo;s the pity.
If there was, and they knowed there was a able-bodied
sailor man like me &rsquo;round about, I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;
been nabbed long ago; and Cap&rsquo;n Forrester
couldn&rsquo;t say as how I&rsquo;d broke my word when
I was took by force aboard a American ship and
made to jine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; persisted Dicky, &ldquo;would you be glad
or sorry if there was a press gang and you was
took?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said Jack sorrowfully, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re axin&rsquo;
me a mighty foolish question. In course I&rsquo;d
be glad. I&rsquo;d run the risk of bein&rsquo; swung up if
we was captured and I was found out&mdash;but
there ain&rsquo;t no chance at all. I&rsquo;ve give my word
to Cap&rsquo;n Forrester, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t break it; and it
ain&rsquo;t likely that I&rsquo;ll be lucky enough to be took
by force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky said no more, but an idea had evidently
taken possession of his mind. His eyes began
to sparkle, he whispered to himself as he sat in
the chimney corner, and his mother saw that
something was up. Jack Bell saw nothing, but
sat and smoked gloomily. The widow gave
Dicky a good supper, and a basket of apples
to take on board with him; and about eight
o&rsquo;clock he started to leave. He motioned to his
mother to come outside with him when he left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mammy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you be scared if
a gang from the Raleigh busts in on you some
night. I won&rsquo;t tell you what it&rsquo;s for, but you
needn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve been in any harm; so just
don&rsquo;t you be scared about me;&rdquo; and without
another word Dicky dashed down the rocky
path to where he was to meet the boat.</p>
<p>Next day, after the men had had their morning
exercise, Dicky went and stood by the mast
as he had seen men do who wished to speak to
the officer of the deck. The officer, Lieutenant
Dobell, advanced to speak with him. Dicky
had rehearsed exactly what he meant to say to
the lieutenant, but when he was actually to say
it, his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth.
At last, though with much stammering and
stuttering, he managed to get out that &ldquo;Mr.
Bell could be took.&rdquo; At first Mr. Dobell could
not make head or tail of Dicky&rsquo;s meaning, but
in a little while it was cleared up. Mr. Dobell,
too, had heard of Jack Bell, and the idea of
having such a steady, reliable man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s-man
on board was very agreeable to him. He
merely told Dicky, though, to say nothing of
what he had told, and he would think over the
matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AN UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER.</span></h2>
<p>About a week after this Dicky was told by
his friend Jenkins, the boatswain&rsquo;s mate,
that he would be needed that night to pilot the
way to his mother&rsquo;s cottage. Dicky grinned
with delight and could hardly wait until night
came. At last, after the longest day he ever
spent, eight o&rsquo;clock arrived. Jenkins called
him and, in company with eight sailors and
Mr. Dobell, they dropped into one of the ship&rsquo;s
boats alongside; and, pulling with a steady man-&rsquo;o-war&rsquo;s
stroke, soon reached a lonely spot on
the shore near the Widow Stubbs&rsquo; cottage and
silently took their march up the rocky path,
Dicky leading to show them the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>Arrived at the cottage they peered through
the window and saw Jack Bell sitting alone and
dismally before the fire, smoking as usual. The
Widow Stubbs was nowhere to be seen. Mr.
Dobell, noticing Jack&rsquo;s brawny figure and hale
and hearty countenance, was more than ever in
favor of having him among the Raleigh&rsquo;s crew.
He directed Dicky to knock at the door, and
Jack opened it, whereupon Mr. Dobell and
Dicky walked in, leaving the eight sailors to
watch outside.</p>
<p>Jack Bell recognized Dicky at once by the
light of the spluttering pine logs, and after a
moment of hesitation rose and saluted Mr.
Dobell.</p>
<p>The officer returned the salute and then said
in a jovial voice:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to know what we came for?
Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. We know that you are a
first-class sailor and a good man, and we want
just such brave fellows on the Raleigh; and, as
I hear you promised Captain Forrester not to
enlist in the American navy, we concluded we&rsquo;d
get you by other means. So come along quietly
with me, or I&rsquo;ll call in eight men I have outside
and take you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a minute Jack Bell&rsquo;s face was a study.
He saw the whole scheme, and the struggle
between his delight and his sense of duty to
his promise was plain. After a moment he
spoke, saluting again as he did so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a uneddicated man,
and maybe that&rsquo;s why it is I don&rsquo;t always
know what my duty is&mdash;but I want to do it if
I can find it out. Now, I don&rsquo;t go for to say as
I don&rsquo;t want to be took&mdash;God knows I do&mdash;but
I hadn&rsquo;t oughter give in without a fight&mdash;and
if you&rsquo;ll jist let me square off and make a
fight agin them eight chaps &rsquo;twould make me
easy in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t stand much of a show, my man,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Dobell, laughing at Jack&rsquo;s simplicity
but respecting it, &ldquo;so you might as well give in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, sir,&rdquo; asked Jack. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
like to have no fightin&rsquo; in a respectable widder
woman&rsquo;s house like this &rsquo;ere&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobell, still
laughing; and stepping to the door he motioned
to the men outside and eight stalwart sailors
marched in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; you won&rsquo;t
git me, but I think it&rsquo;s my duty to give you all
the trouble I can, so I&rsquo;ll just take this poker&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>Jack reached forward and was about to seize
the poker, when Dicky, as active as a cat,
whisked it out of the way. The next weapon
at hand was a stool, but before Jack could get
hold of it Mr. Dobell gave it a kick which sent
it flying. The sailors closed in with a rush, but
Jack, with his stout arms swinging around like
a Dutch windmill, laid more than one of them
low before he was overpowered. The struggle
was short and sharp, and in a minute or two
Jack&rsquo;s arms were pinioned by a couple of grinning
sailors, while two that he had floored were
scrambling to their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Jack to Mr. Dobell, &ldquo;I calls you
to witness that I made a fight for my promise,
and I axes you to give me your word in writin&rsquo;
as how I was took by force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; answered Mr. Dobell, &ldquo;and I think
you have barked the shins and blacked the eyes
of two of my men, so come along. You, boy,
remain here until your mother comes to explain
affairs to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was carried on board the Raleigh and
in due course of time was offered his choice by
Captain Thompson of enlisting or being put in
irons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; said Jack respectfully,
&ldquo;now as you&rsquo;ve took me I&rsquo;ve got to sarve,
but I&rsquo;d ruther not be on the ship&rsquo;s books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Captain Thompson,
&ldquo;I would enlist you under another name.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t that, sir,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo;
to sarve for my vittles and does, but I don&rsquo;t
want no pay and no prize money, because I
want to let Cap&rsquo;n Forrester know some day as
I didn&rsquo;t break my word and I didn&rsquo;t make
nothin&rsquo; out of bein&rsquo; took, and I ax you to make
a note in writin&rsquo; and give it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>This the captain agreed to do, and Jack, with
his testimony from Mr. Dobell and that from
the captain stored away in his ditty box, took his
place among the ship&rsquo;s crew with a goodwill
and the happiest heart in the world. Captain
Thompson, moreover, to ease Jack&rsquo;s mind still
further, gave orders that he was to be watched
and on no account to be given liberty to go
ashore, so that even had he wished to run away
he would have found it impossible; and within
a week the Raleigh had tripped her anchor and
was off for a cruise along the southern coast.
Never were there two happier human beings than
Jack Bell and Dicky Stubbs. Dicky, it is true,
occasionally felt down-hearted when he thought
how lonely his mother must be, but he chose
rather to think of the joy of meeting her again,
and determined to try meanwhile and lead the
life his mother would wish him to lead. Jack
kept a sharp eye on him and if he showed any
slight inclination to do what was not perfectly
correct, or to shirk his work, Jack would bring
him up with a round turn. So, what with a
naturally good disposition and a wholesome
restraint and discipline Dicky was both a good
and a useful boy. His singing made him universally
popular on board, and he was often
sent for in the long evenings to sing to the
officers in the ward room and even to the captain
in the cabin. As for the fok&rsquo;sle, Dicky could
easily have got all of his work done in exchange
for his singing, which was a great diversion,
particularly when one of the petty officers
taught him to scrape a little on the violin. But
Jack Bell was always at hand to make him do
his full share and more of all there was to do&mdash;in
which Jack proved himself to be Dicky&rsquo;s
best friend. The story of the song about General
Prescott had got abroad in the ship and
Dicky was incessantly chaffed about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>Jack had been a signal man for many years
in the British navy and amused his leisure time
while cruising by making a tolerably complete
set of signal flags to use in an emergency.
Dicky, who would much rather have been
singing and fiddling than sewing, was nevertheless
made to help Jack, and the two passed
many hours sitting together on the gun deck
stitching away industriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what mammy&rsquo;ll say when she
finds I can play the fiddle,&rdquo; Dicky would ask
with boyish conceit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; Jack would answer, slyly chaffing
Dicky, &ldquo;but I reckon she&rsquo;ll be mightily pleased
when she finds you can sew up a pair o&rsquo; breeches
as good as any tailor man as ever set cross-legged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to do no sewin&rsquo; when
I&rsquo;m ashore,&rdquo; cried Dicky, his dignity much
wounded. &ldquo;I only do it now because I&rsquo;m
obliged to, and mammy won&rsquo;t ask or expect me
to sew up my own breeches at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps not,&rdquo; Jack would answer diplomatically.</p>
<p>They had cruised now for some weeks and
had captured several small merchant ships, but
Captain Thompson was looking for a warship
to engage. On a bright September evening
they sighted a large fleet of merchantmen which
they hoped might be convoyed by a ship of war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>There was a good breeze, and the Raleigh
being an excellent sailer both on and off the
wind laid her head for the fleet. To divert suspicion
and to appear like a merchantman, Captain
Thompson hoisted the British ensign, lowered
his ports, and had his guns on deck covered
with tarpaulins. He sent the men below with
instructions at the first tap of the drum to go
to quarters, and Dicky as drummer boy was
ordered to bring his drum on deck, where he hid
it behind a gun and covered it with his jacket.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon before the ships
had been seen and it was near sunset when the
Raleigh, flying British colors, sailed boldly in
among the fleet. There were sixteen or seventeen
vessels, somewhat widely separated, and
one large ship, considerably to windward, whose
squareness of rig and generally fine appearance
induced Captain Thompson to think she might
be a heavy British frigate. But if so her commander
had disguised her so effectually that her
real character could not be known until the
Raleigh got considerably closer than she was
then.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>When the Raleigh got within signaling distance
of the fleet, Captain Thompson sent for
Jack Bell, who, with Dicky Stubbs to help him,
spread out his signal flags. All of the officers
were on deck except Mr. Dobell, the first lieutenant,
who was ill in his berth, just recovering
from a sharp attack of rheumatism. The
second lieutenant, therefore, was to superintend
the signaling. The large ship was plainly
visible on the horizon when the sun was sinking
in a blaze of glory. As soon as Jack Bell
caught sight of her he said to the lieutenant
very respectfully:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Axin&rsquo; your parding, sir, but that &rsquo;ere ship is
a seventy-four. I sarved forty year in the
British navy, and I can tell one o&rsquo; them ships
as fur as I can see &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are mistaken, Bell,&rdquo; answered the
young officer, who did not know as much about
the run and rig of a seventy-four as Jack Bell.
&ldquo;No doubt there is a warship somewhere about
convoying the fleet, but it is not that large ship
off the quarter; but I will speak to the captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Thompson agreed with his second
lieutenant that the ship was not a seventy-four.
Jack said no more, and the twilight coming on,
the ship, although she grew larger as they approached
her, also grew less distinct in her
character and outlines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>Captain Thompson then sailed boldly into
the fleet of merchantmen and signaled, &ldquo;Where
is your convoy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The signal was evidently understood, as the
nearest vessel promptly hung out several
signal flags in reply. But in the dusky evening,
it was impossible to read them. However,
the American captain thought it prudent
to act as if he had read them, and signaled
back, &ldquo;We have orders to find your convoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The impudence of this tickled the Americans,
and the officers with difficulty suppressed a
cheer from the men. Dicky Stubbs laughed so
loud that Jack Bell gave him a whack in good
earnest, which caused Dicky to be perfectly
quiet afterward.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the big ship was evidently edging
off, which made the sanguine Americans certain
that she was a merchant ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she is&mdash;and maybe she&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo;
until we gits under her broadside,&rdquo; mumbled
Jack Bell to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s shy, my men,&rdquo; cried Captain Thompson,
who was young and brave and rash,
pointing to the ship, which continued to edge
off. &ldquo;We will signal her and see what
account she will give of herself,&rdquo; continued the
captain.</p>
<p>The little Raleigh had now lessened the distance
nearly one half between herself and the
big ship, which showed not a single porthole
and seemed to be keeping off most determinedly.
Accordingly the Raleigh signaled,
&ldquo;Where is your convoy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faint moon showed its shimmering disk over
the horizon, and those on the Raleigh could
plainly read the stranger&rsquo;s answer:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Raleigh then made this bold assertion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have your superior officer aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By that time the Raleigh had gained on the
big ship, which still showed a disposition to get
away. Nevertheless it signaled back: &ldquo;We
think you are mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>By that time both ships were running free on
the same tack, under a good working breeze.
Suddenly the stranger luffed short around; her
whole starboard side seemed to fly open; a
double row of heavy guns were run out, as if
by magic, and the whole broadside of a seventy-four
roared out and raked the American from
stem to stern. Fortunately the men had been
kept below, in the effort to disguise the Raleigh,
and by extreme good fortune, although several
of the few officers and men on deck were
wounded and all were thrown to the deck, none
were killed. But the destruction on the ship was
frightful. Many of her guns were dismounted,
her masts and spars were so wounded that she
became for the time unmanageable, and it was
plain that she could not survive another such
broadside.</p>
<p>Captain Thompson, with blood streaming
down his face, soon regained his feet&mdash;but one
glance showed him the state of affairs. The
Raleigh had lost her leeway and swung around
with her head to the wind, perfectly helpless
under the guns of her huge antagonist. The
seventy-four meanwhile, shortening sail with
the utmost quickness and precision, was in a
few minutes ready to repeat her performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will give her one round for the honor
of the flag, if we go to the bottom for it,&rdquo; cried
Captain Thompson. &ldquo;Sound your drum, boy,
as loud as you can!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>Dicky at this began a tremendous tattoo, at
the first sound of which the men rushed from
below, and running to their quarters every gun
on the Raleigh&rsquo;s port side, which lay toward the
seventy-four, thundered out&mdash;and, immediately
after, the American ensign was hauled down, as
resistance was useless. In another moment a
boat was lowered from the seventy-four and
pulled toward the Raleigh. The officers, with
Captain Thompson at their head, stood at the
port gangway to receive the boarding officer.</p>
<p>It had passed so quickly that Dicky was
stunned by it all. He saw as in a dream the
British officer come aboard, Captain Thompson
offer his sword, which was courteously declined&mdash;and
he, with the other officers, taken off to
the British ship, which turned out to be the
Ajax, one of the finest seventy-fours in the
British navy. Not a murmur was heard against
Captain Thompson, whose rashness had brought
the Raleigh&rsquo;s company to that evil pass. He
had made a frightful mistake, but it was the
mistake of a brave man, duped by a skilful
enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE ENEMY OUTWITTED.</span></h2>
<p>A prize crew was immediately thrown on
board the Raleigh, but with the contempt
for the American navy which the British naturally
felt at the time, it was thought enough to
send a young lieutenant, a midshipman, and
twenty men to take charge of the American
ship. The crew were all on deck, about to be
mustered by their captors, when Jack Bell, finding
Dicky Stubbs, pale and awed, standing next
him, whispered very softly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has you seen Mr. Dobell anywheres
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Dicky just as softly, &ldquo;he
ain&rsquo;t able to move hardly yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;You slip below, then,&rdquo; Jack continued hurriedly
but impressively, &ldquo;and tell him there ain&rsquo;t
but twenty men and two officers aboard&mdash;and
they thinks they has got all the officers&mdash;and
if he kin manage to git into the men&rsquo;s quarters
and git a suit of sailor&rsquo;s clo&rsquo;es on him, they
won&rsquo;t never suspect we has a officer among us;
but if we has an officer, we can git the ship
back before they knows it. Now, can you
remember that, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Dicky&mdash;and in the
confusion he easily managed to get below.
With his heart in his mouth he ran to Mr.
Dobell&rsquo;s room. The lieutenant, much disabled
by rheumatism, had yet managed to crawl as
far as his door. He surmised only too well the
state of affairs above, and when Dicky in an
agitated whisper gave Jack Bell&rsquo;s message,
Dobell saw at once what was meant. Only
twenty men and two young officers! He balanced
rapidly in his own mind the chances he
took, not forgetting the parole that he might
expect as an officer, and the imprisonment he
might suffer if he assumed the character of an
ordinary seaman&mdash;but he saw the opportunity
opening before him, and he also knew how level-headed
and experienced Jack Bell was in spite
of his humble position and want of school education.
Nor did Mr. Dobell forget that although
in the excitement of the moment he might have
been overlooked for a little while, that very
soon he would be inquired after and searched
for&mdash;but a plan instantly suggested itself to
him on that point. Picking up his cap he hobbled,
with Dicky&rsquo;s assistance, down to the men&rsquo;s
quarters. Nearly all the lights had been put
out by the shock of the Ajax&rsquo;s broadside, but
by Mr. Dobell&rsquo;s instructions Dicky put out every
one in their wake that remained. He then
told the boy as they passed the carpenters&rsquo;
quarters to look around for a grindstone that
he could lift. Dicky got hold of one that he
could lift very handily, as he was a strong boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobell hurriedly, &ldquo;get
some sailor togs on me; then put my officer&rsquo;s
clothes up in a bundle and hide them until I
can get a chance to throw them overboard;
and next throw the grindstone overboard, with
my cap after it, and rush up shouting, &lsquo;Man
overboard!&rsquo; and they will think it is I&mdash;but
tell Bell privately that I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By that time they were in the sickbay, where
there were two or three men ill, and in a
minute or two Mr. Dobell was in a hammock,
looking as ill as any of them. Dicky ran back
and by almost superhuman efforts managed to
get the heavy grindstone overboard and threw
Mr. Dobell&rsquo;s cap after it. A loud splash was
heard, and Dicky rushed up on deck shouting,
&ldquo;Man overboard!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>This added to the commotion prevailing on
deck. The boarding boat was at the gangway,
and the young midshipman jumping in, the
boat&rsquo;s crew pulled toward the bow of the boat,
where the splash had been heard. They saw
an officer&rsquo;s cap floating near by and it was
picked up, and for half an hour they pulled
back and forth over the place where the grindstone
had gone down, upon the chance of
saving the supposed unfortunate officer.</p>
<p>On deck Jack Bell, by some occult means,
had passed the word around among the Americans
that something was up and they must be
on their guard. When the boat returned with
the officer&rsquo;s cap, it was at once identified as Mr.
Dobell&rsquo;s by the initials in it, and on looking
into his room it was found empty. The British
lieutenant thought he had conclusive proof that
the first lieutenant had either fallen or jumped
overboard; and Jack Bell propounded a plausible
theory that Mr. Dobell, being unable to get
on deck, had managed to lean out of the cabin
window so far, in his effort to see what was happening
above, that he lost his balance and fell
overboard. &ldquo;And he were a good officer, were
Mr. Dobell,&rdquo; said Jack with much feeling; &ldquo;and
he must ha&rsquo; felt awful bad when he knowed he
couldn&rsquo;t lift his hand to help the poor Raleigh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s theory was shared by the British officers,
and when they found two or three sailors in the
sickbay it did not occur to them that the one
who appeared the most ill was the first lieutenant
of the ship.</p>
<p>In a little while the ship was completely under
the control of her captors and nearly a hundred
American prisoners were sent below the hatches,
while the damages to the ship were repaired as
far as possible. This was not finished until
morning, when the Ajax and her prize parted
company, the Raleigh being directed to report
at Philadelphia, which had then fallen in the
power of the British.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>The melancholy news of Mr. Dobell&rsquo;s supposed
loss had been conveyed to his old shipmates
on the Ajax, and added to the distress
they suffered. The American prisoners on the
Raleigh, although closely guarded, were perfectly
free to communicate with each other. A
plan was formed to seize the ship as soon as
Mr. Dobell was able to move about, which would
be shortly, as he was mending fast. A sentry,
fully armed, always stood at the hatchway,
but if once he could be disarmed or thrown
off his guard, the Americans rushing up could
get possession of the deck, and the rest
would be easy. Mr. Dobell had the management
of the whole scheme, and it was desired
to carry it into effect before they reached
Northern waters which swarmed with British
cruisers. Jack Bell was Mr. Dobell&rsquo;s righthand
man; and after two or three days, when the
lieutenant was able to get about his cramped
quarters fairly well, Jack took Dicky aside and
whispered to him: &ldquo;When the officer comes
down to inspect to-morrow morning, do you
be singing the prettiest song you have, and
fiddling, too, and maybe he&rsquo;ll notice you;
and then I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>Next morning, therefore, when the officer
came below, Dicky was singing away like a
thrush &ldquo;When the Wind at Night Whistles
Over the Deep,&rdquo; and playing his accompaniment
on the violin. He stopped, as if
caught by the officer; but apparently the
young British lieutenant had no ear for music
and passed on without noticing him. The
British sailors, though, had heard him, and as
music was highly prized on board ship to break
the monotony, Dicky was soon asked for, to
sing and play to the men in the fok&rsquo;sle during
their leisure hours. Thus, he was often allowed
on deck for an hour at a time, and never failed
to use his eyes very sharply and to carry down
the news to Mr. Dobell, whose character as an
officer was not in the least suspected by his
captors. They had experienced contrary winds,
and although ten days had passed since the
Raleigh&rsquo;s capture, they had not yet passed the
capes of North Carolina.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>On a certain day though, when Mr. Dobell
was able to walk about with comfort, Dicky had
got his instructions, and with a beating heart but
an undaunted courage he went above, when he
was called for. It was Sunday, and the few
sailors that could be spared were sitting around
the fok&rsquo;sle smoking and spinning yarns. Dinner
had been served to them and directly afterward
the hatches would be opened to send the prisoners&rsquo;
dinner down to them. Dicky was permitted
to go as far as the main hatchway. It
had just been opened and two cooks descended,
followed by two sailors armed with pistols and
cutlasses. As they disappeared below a slight
noise, as of scuffling bare feet, was heard. The
sentry, with his piece at his shoulder, advanced,
and at the same moment Dicky, rushing at him
from behind, pulled his legs from under him
and he fell sprawling down the hatchway. In
another minute the Americans came rushing up
on deck headed by Mr. Dobell who, although
unable to take any active part, yet commanded
with skill and coolness. They had the pistols
and cutlasses of the two sailors they had disarmed
below, and they had seized the musket
and pistols of the sentry. In another moment
the sailors sitting around the fok&rsquo;sle were overpowered
before they had a chance to make any
resistance, and Mr. Dobell, directing pistols to
be leveled at the heads of the lookouts, they
came down with alacrity. All this was done
with surprisingly little noise, as the Americans
had been ordered to act as quietly as possible
and had left their shoes below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>Fifteen out of the twenty men had been
captured, and it was now determined to bag the
two officers. Mr. Dobell, who had become
wonderfully active under the influence of excitement
and success, quickly and noiselessly
descended the cabin hatchway. The cabin door
was open, and the lieutenant, with his back to it,
sat at the table calmly enjoying his dinner;
while the young midshipman, leaning on the
transom, craned his neck far out of a porthole
to see what caused the faint but strange noises
on deck.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobell signaled to two brawny young
Americans who walked abreast with him, and
the next instant a stout arm encircled the lieutenant&rsquo;s
head, across his eyes, and a pair of
equally stout arms pinioned him behind. The
lieutenant uttered a loud yell, but the midshipman
with his head out of the port did not hear
it. He felt, though, someone dragging him
backward, and the next thing he knew he was
gracefully seated on the floor and the cabin
was full of Americans. By that time the
five remaining British sailors had been overpowered
and the ship was in the hands of the
Americans.</p>
<p>The lieutenant struggled violently for an
instant, when Mr. Dobell spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remove your arm from his eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>The sailor who had covered the officer&rsquo;s eyes
took his arm away. The young lieutenant gave
one quick glance around and became perfectly
quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobell, &ldquo;this ship is in possession
of the Americans, and to show you that
it is, you shall be freed from personal restraint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sailor who held him let go, and the lieutenant
rose and looked about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; he said coolly, &ldquo;there is no
commissioned officer among you, and it is not
likely that any of you foremast people can
navigate a ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; answered Mr. Dobell
politely, &ldquo;but I am Lieutenant Dobell of the
Continental navy, and I feel altogether capable
of taking this ship anywhere I wish. It was
not I, but a grindstone, that fell overboard the
night of the capture. I felt that with an officer
to direct them our men could get the ship back,
and for that reason I chose to spend my time
below the hatches. Now, however, I promise
myself the pleasure of your company in the
cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lieutenant, not to be outdone in politeness,
answered with admirable self-possession:
&ldquo;When you have made your dispositions on
the ship I should be pleased to have your company
at dinner, for I conceive myself the host
at this one meal at least.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; responded Mr. Dobell. &ldquo;I
will not keep you longer than I can possibly
help, for I acknowledge that the fare and table
service under the hatches has not been altogether
to my liking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobell then went on deck, and directing
the prisoners to be mustered, they were marched
below and occupied the late quarters of the
Americans. No bad blood was shown on either
side, but a philosophic acceptance of a change
of conditions. Mr. Dobell had his plans so
well made and easily carried out that within
half an hour he rejoined the lieutenant in the
cabin and ate the first good meal he had enjoyed
for ten days; while the Raleigh, once more an
American ship, bounded along under a freshening
breeze to the music of three thundering
cheers, given by the Americans as soon as they
had leisure to celebrate their adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>Dicky Stubbs was the happiest little soul
imaginable. He had been the only one among
all the Americans allowed on deck, and the
news he had carried below, and his achievements
in pulling the sentry&rsquo;s legs from under
him, made Dicky a considerable hero in his
own eyes. But Mr. Dobell, after seeing the
boy every day in the time of their imprisonment,
had concluded that he was a remarkably
brave, sensible, and reliable boy, and had
determined to interest himself in Dicky&rsquo;s future
welfare.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobell decided to make for Newport.
They had favoring breezes all the way and
passed many British cruisers, to all of which
the Raleigh showed British colors and signaled
that she had been taken from the Americans.
But whenever a disposition was shown to speak
her, she always made off with a swiftness that
caused many an angry captain to promise himself
the pleasure of reporting her to the admiral
as wanting in the first principle of that courtesy
which should prevail upon the seas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>The melancholy news that the Raleigh had
been captured by the Ajax was brought to
Newport one day by a trader from New York;
and there was no sadder heart in Newport than
that of the Widow Stubbs. She spent no time,
however, in useless lamenting, for she had given
her boy to her country cheerfully and knew
what the sacrifice meant. And she consoled
herself by thinking that it was after all but a
temporal misfortune, not comparable to what
might have been had Dicky been caught lying,
stealing, or playing the rascal in any way. But
she could not refrain from crying a little when,
about sunset on the day the bad news came,
she looked out of the window of her little
house and thought that was the time that
Dicky had been wont to come home jingling
his pennies in his pockets with a vast air of
importance before throwing them into her lap,
and then demanding his supper as if he owned
the earth. But&mdash;strange sight!&mdash;there lay a
handsome little frigate at anchor in the harbor
that looked astonishingly like the Raleigh; and&mdash;oh,
happy miracle!&mdash;there was Dicky himself
rushing up the path, followed by Jack Bell on a
dog trot; and then the door burst open and
Dicky, grown about a foot taller and broader,
jumped into his mother&rsquo;s arms, and Jack Bell
marched in and began sawing her arm up and
down. The Widow Stubbs was so amazed,
astounded, and delighted that she was quite
beside herself; and Dicky poured out a rigmarole,
his tongue going like a millwheel, all
about knocking the sentry down, and playing
the fiddle, and what Mr. Dobell was going to
do for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does he mean, Mr. Bell?&rdquo; asked the
Widow Stubbs helplessly, after having hugged
and kissed Dicky twenty times over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brat means, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; responded Jack as
he solemnly cut a large quid of tobacco and
placed it in his cheek, &ldquo;as how he&rsquo;s did his
duty&mdash;no more and no less&mdash;but, like all
brats, he&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; a big hullabaloo over jest
a-doin&rsquo; of his duty, like &rsquo;twas sumpin&rsquo; extryordinary.
I don&rsquo;t go for to say as he ain&rsquo;t a
smart chap&mdash;but he&rsquo;s had adwantages, bein&rsquo;
took young into the navy, where most of the
smart men is found, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;and I think he&rsquo;ll
live to be a credit and a comfort to you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will, if he only does his duty just as it
lies before him,&rdquo; said the widow softly, and
kissing Dicky&rsquo;s freckled nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to, mammy,&rdquo; answered Dicky
sturdily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>And he kept his promise very faithfully.
The day came, when the war was over and
America was free, that his mother saw him
captain of a fine ship and able to give her a
better house to live in than she had ever known
in all her life. Jack Bell took possession of the
little cottage, where he spent many happy years,
and always pointed to the brave, bright, and
successful Captain Richard Stubbs as a monument
of what &ldquo;bein&rsquo; ketched young and put
into the navy&rdquo; would do for a man.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
